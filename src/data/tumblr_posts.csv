Yes, yes, hello! It’s finally Halloween week, and we hope you're all enjoying the little creep haunting the like button. Today, we’re celebrating some of the folks out there creating Halloween-themed dividers to elevate all your spooky fics and posts. What would we do without them?!
Please enjoy, and do proceed with caution—we've got some flashing, mild gore, blood, and bones here. 'Tis the season, after all.

2025-12-05T06:58:49.330777,"Tumblr Tuesday: Halloween! Dividers!
Yes, yes, hello! It’s finally Halloween week, and we hope you're all enjoying the little creep haunting the like button. Today, we’re celebrating some of the folks out there creating Halloween-themed dividers to elevate all your spooky fics and posts. What would we do without them?!
Please enjoy, and do proceed with caution—we've got some flashing, mild gore, blood, and bones here. 'Tis the season, after all.
(Each of these dividers comes from a themed collection—tap the attribution on your faves to see the whole set!)

Hey Tumblr, your security is super important to us. In light of a recent surge in scams, we want to make sure you have all the tools and knowledge to keep your account safe:
Verify the source: If someone claiming to be from Tumblr Support reaches out, always check the sender's email address. Official Tumblr communication will come from tumblr.com or tumblr.zendesk.com domains, and Tumblr will never contact you via another platform.
Don’t click suspicious links: Check the destination of a URL before clicking, and look for anything that doesn't seem right, such as a misspelled website name. 
Recognize phishing: Phishing messages or emails often try to create a sense of urgency (""Your account will be suspended if you don't click here now!""). They might also contain grammatical errors or poor formatting. 
Never share your password: Tumblr staff will never ask you for your password. If anyone asks for your password, it's a scam.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone gets your password, they can't access your account without the second verification step. You can enable 2FA in your account settings.
For more on avoiding scams and keeping your account safe, check out the Help Center. 
If you ever suspect your account has been compromised, or encounter a scam, a suspicious message, or a fake account, contact Tumblr Support.

How much creechure can we fit in one post, you ask? Well, @artfight is upon us, and the Fossils and Crystals are having it out by depicting each other's original characters—so the answer is a lot of creechure. But maybe not enough?  
Featuring lots of mutual appreciation (artists spending hours with each other's ideas!), incredible character design, and beautiful depictions thereof, take this as your invitation to get involved. You can sign up and start fighting (using your artistic talents), or simply enjoy the wealth of beautiful art styles and cool ocs coming to the fore. This is but a small selection, may you peruse the rest at your leisure.

It finally happened. After some romancing in the ballpit, we popped the question and, folks, THEY SAID YES. 
In short, we're in love! Now, we're in need of a ship name. Can you help? Vote below, or let us know if you come up with something better. This is now a matter of grave importance.
Pick a ship name for Ao3 x Tumblr:

(Thanks to all the folks on X who added some excellent (& some funny) suggestions to our little list)
Anyway, the fan art is already absolutely incredible, thank you for celebrating with us:

It finally happened. After some romancing in the ballpit, we popped the question and, folks, THEY SAID YES. 
In short, we're in love! Now, we're in need of a ship name. Can you help? Vote below, or let us know if you come up with something better. This is now a matter of grave importance.

Anyway, the fan art is already absolutely incredible, thank you for celebrating with us:

Apple has always focused on providing a great experience, from the presentations to what it proposes for the developers. On the second day of the WWDC21 event, a theme that keeps coming back is the importance of a more inclusive and accessible design on all of the different application scopes.
It can even be seen in the language that we use and look for reference, respecting different perspectives, adopting more accessibility features, making our design more inclusive, especially in the area of content that includes writing, images, audio, video, it can be seen everywhere... everything we use to ""talk"" to our audience. 🗣🗣🗣
Despite being a topic of great importance, my main concern is that it makes us wonder if our products are in fact meeting these expectations as much as possible. ❤️

Bringing more accessibility features ✅
Dynamic type is not new. It's something that has been around since iOS 7, but its adoption by apps has been somewhat slow. Since iOS 11, Apple has been making significant improvements to the feature that should lead to wide-scale adoption.
Getting a little more technical... ⚙️🛠
Dynamic type supports up to seven size settings, but that's not the limit, for example, the body text style is 17pt in the default setting, but can range from 14pt to 23pt, and we can, in extreme cases count with the accessibility setting that supports even larger fonts up to 53pt for body text.
My mother ❤️is a great example of someone that is heavily dependent on this particular feature. Communication and social networking apps that have a lot of content in a very small screen real estate (iPhone screen) can take advantage of this and avoid losing any content due to the lack of space.
Does Tumblr handle Dynamic Type?
Tumblr allows us to share many different types of media in a single post. That makes the content super cool and unique, however, posts that have a lot of ""regular"" sized text, despite having good contrast (✨bonus points for Tumblr here!✨) still, readability can be compromised when compared to a wider range of users.
To make our vision even more inclusive when developing our apps, it's necessary to start by making the design process more inclusive as well. I'm sure this will affect the design and implementation of a good application. 📱

Dynamic type supports up to seven size settings, but that's not the limit, for example, the body text style is 17pt in the default setting, but can range from 14pt to 23pt, and we can, in extreme cases count with the accessibility setting that supports even larger fonts up to 53pt for body text.
My mother ❤️is a great example of someone that is heavily dependent on this particular feature. Communication and social networking apps that have a lot of content in a very small screen real estate (iPhone screen) can take advantage of this and avoid losing any content due to the lack of space.
Does Tumblr handle Dynamic Type?
Tumblr allows us to share many different types of media in a single post. That makes the content super cool and unique, however, posts that have a lot of ""regular"" sized text, despite having good contrast (✨bonus points for Tumblr here!✨) still, readability can be compromised when compared to a wider range of users.
To make our vision even more inclusive when developing our apps, it's necessary to start by making the design process more inclusive as well. I'm sure this will affect the design and implementation of a good application. 📱

2025-12-05T07:00:24.096341,"A better inclusive and accessible design
Apple has always focused on providing a great experience, from the presentations to what it proposes for the developers. On the second day of the WWDC21 event, a theme that keeps coming back is the importance of a more inclusive and accessible design on all of the different application scopes.
It can even be seen in the language that we use and look for reference, respecting different perspectives, adopting more accessibility features, making our design more inclusive, especially in the area of content that includes writing, images, audio, video, it can be seen everywhere... everything we use to ""talk"" to our audience. 🗣🗣🗣
Despite being a topic of great importance, my main concern is that it makes us wonder if our products are in fact meeting these expectations as much as possible. ❤️
Below you can see the two sessions that talk more about it.

2025-12-05T07:00:24.235838,"Tumblr for a new user on iOS
I have been using Tumblr for the past week, before that, I have never really jumped into it.
My first impression of the platform was that it was a more user choice-focused platform, kinda like Reddit. I got this impression from the Markdown and HTML editors that you can use to customize your blog and write posts. I was really impressed that a modern social media company still allowed the choice to edit custom HTML for blogs and a rich content editor for posts. However, this was all in the web interface…
When I opened the iPad app, I quickly realized that the app is nowhere near optimized for the iPad or any of Apple’s newer technologies. In this post, I will be going over how I think Tumblr can take some of the new technologies Apple has released so far in WWDC and make their platform one of the most advanced social media on iOS.
What I think Tumblr could improve upon
The iPad UI
Other posts have touched a lot more on Tumblr’s iPad UI so I will not go as in-depth as them. However I do have to say, it really needs improvement. Having one central post-column looks comical on an iPad and really ruins the look and feel of Tumblr. I think adapting to Apple’s new multi-column layouts for iPad would be an amazing choice for Tumblr.
Supporting new technologies like multi-column layouts would put Tumblr ahead of the competition. A lot of social media currently do not support iPad’s as well as they could. They just show a scaled-up version of their mobile interface. This leads to a lot of annoyances about the iPad app. With a lot of people moving to iPad’s as the main device, having an unoptimized iPad app will send people away from using Tumblr as their blogging platform.
Multitasking
Apple so far has talked a lot about the new iPad multitasking features. Now there isn’t really much at all that has been added, it is just way more discoverable than before. With more discoverability comes more users looking to use it in their favorite apps.
When I tried to use Tumblr in a multitasking manner, it just fails to work. There is no way to have multiple windows of the app, and when it is in split-screen the UI fails to adapt well. I believe adding support for iPad’s new multitasking features will allow Tumblr to fly ahead of other social media at a user experience level. On Apple devices, Everything Just Works. And for the Tumblr app and multitasking, it doesn’t. New and returning users will look to use multitasking and then learn that it is not supported, leaving them a little disappointed. I think supporting features like these are essential for Tumblr to thrive in the growing social media space.
Shortcuts Support
A lot of my time is spent using and creating Shortcuts. I really wish that Tumblr had a lot more support for Shortcuts. Currently, Tumblr has one action, and you need to login into that action inside the Shortcuts app. Even if you are logged into the Tumblr app on your device. I think that improved support for Shortcuts will be necessary for the future for any app on an Apple Platform. Doing simple things: like opening a specific blog, or going to your favorite creator’s page, should all be doable through Shortcuts actions. Apple has been putting a lot of time and development into Shortcuts, and I really believe that Tumblr should integrate as well as it can into the Shortcut ecosystem.

You've probably already skipped those introductory screens that explain how the application works, a.k.a onboardings, or you've given up putting your information on a very long form. I know! I was also on that boat once! 👀👀
Although there are several super cool new technologies and features, it's also necessary that we know how to apply them in a correct way, ensuring a more fluid and pleasing experience within the application. The same applies to releasing a new feature, for example, how can people learn what your app is able to do?

You've probably already skipped those introductory screens that explain how the application works, a.k.a onboardings, or you've given up putting your information on a very long form. I know! I was also on that boat once! 👀👀
Although there are several super cool new technologies and features, it's also necessary that we know how to apply them in a correct way, ensuring a more fluid and pleasing experience within the application. The same applies to releasing a new feature, for example, how can people learn what your app is able to do?

2025-12-05T07:00:25.775756,"We posted an update about this back in April, and now as of July 1st, it’s really, really here, for everyone: the old dashboard has been replaced with our brand new web experience on desktop. This has been a very long time in the making, and the primary reason behind it is to make the desktop web experience of Tumblr easier to maintain and build on top of.
We’re continuing to improve the experience of using Tumblr on the web with some new features, some of which were formerly a part of XKit and other third party extensions:
Color Palettes are now available to change the whole look of the site, just use the “Change Palette” option by clicking on the silhouette icon at the top right.
Viewing tags used in reblogs is now available in the notes view on every post.
You can now filter posts by their text content, not just by tags.
Timestamps are available by hovering over the “fold” at the top right of any post, or now also available by clicking on the meatballs menu at the top right of any post. There are a lot of new options in there, too!
The dashboard now soft refreshes by default, so you don’t have to press that browser button to see the latest content.
Audio in audio posts can now “pop out” so you can see it while you scroll your dashboard.

2025-12-05T07:00:25.815328,"We posted an update about this back in April, and now as of July 1st, it’s really, really here, for everyone: the old dashboard has been replaced with our brand new web experience on desktop. This has been a very long time in the making, and the primary reason behind it is to make the desktop web experience of Tumblr easier to maintain and build on top of.
We’re continuing to improve the experience of using Tumblr on the web with some new features, some of which were formerly a part of XKit and other third party extensions:
Color Palettes are now available to change the whole look of the site, just use the “Change Palette” option by clicking on the silhouette icon at the top right.
Viewing tags used in reblogs is now available in the notes view on every post.
You can now filter posts by their text content, not just by tags.
Timestamps are available by hovering over the “fold” at the top right of any post, or now also available by clicking on the meatballs menu at the top right of any post. There are a lot of new options in there, too!
The dashboard now soft refreshes by default, so you don’t have to press that browser button to see the latest content.
Audio in audio posts can now “pop out” so you can see it while you scroll your dashboard.

2025-12-05T07:00:26.706308,"Dusting off the cobwebs
Over the past couple of weeks, we have slowly rolled out a spiffy new version of Tumblr on the web. Here’s a smattering of goodies in the update:
Dark mode is now available on the web! Along with a few other color schemes, too. Just click the silhouette figure in the upper right corner and then click “Change Palette” to cycle through all of ‘em.
You can now view your likes page in the default view or in the new grid view.
Same with any tagged pages. Here, try it out with the frog tag. A glorious grid.
Copying the link to a post, reporting a post, or blocking someone whose content you don’t enjoy is easier than ever. Just click the meatballs menu (●●●)  in the upper right corner.
Some of these visual changes are obvious, but the biggest transformation is the one you can’t see. This wasn’t just a facelift, we completely updated the web interface. The old one was outdated—over a decade old. Adding features to it wasn’t always easy, fixing bugs wasn’t always quick. It was clear that we needed to update the whole dang thing. So update the whole dang thing we did. The result? A faster Tumblr. The experience is smoother, it’s easier to add new features, and we’re able to squash any pesky bugs quicker than before.
XKit
This kind of web interface change means that some of your Tumblr browser extensions may not work. We understand how important these extensions are to those of you who want to customize your Tumblr experience as much as possible. Throughout this process, we’ve stayed in close communication with the people over at @new-xkit-extension to make sure our update was one that they could work with. We provided them with APIs they needed to begin moving over to this new platform. This also gave us the opportunity to discuss the benefits their extension brings to the community. Having their input on what makes their service valuable to the people who use it has been a true treat, and one we are grateful for. While XKit isn’t an official Tumblr tool, it’s one we know is dear to many of you, and we don’t take that lightly. If you have any concerns, we encourage you to read more about what they have to say over here. Be sure to follow them to stay updated on their process!
We want to hear from you
Yeah, you. When we first began testing this new interface with a small selection of you, we received some really useful feedback. We want to make sure that continues, so we created a survey. While we always read the reblogs on our announcement posts, this survey is the best way to let us know exactly how you feel about this update. And don’t worry—it’s anonymous. We won’t know who you are unless you make it your business to tell us so.

Throughout this process, we’ve stayed in close communication with the people over at @new-xkit-extension to make sure our update was one that they could work with. We provided them with APIs they needed to begin moving over to this new platform. This also gave us the opportunity to discuss the benefits their extension brings to the community. Having their input on what makes their service valuable to the people who use it has been a true treat, and one we are grateful for. While XKit isn’t an official Tumblr tool, it’s one we know is dear to many of you, and we don’t take that lightly. If you have any concerns, we encourage you to read more about what they have to say over here. Be sure to follow them to stay updated on their process!
We want to hear from you
Yeah, you. When we first began testing this new interface with a small selection of you, we received some really useful feedback. We want to make sure that continues, so we created a survey. While we always read the reblogs on our announcement posts, this survey is the best way to let us know exactly how you feel about this update. And don’t worry—it’s anonymous.

Over the past couple of weeks, we have slowly rolled out a spiffy new version of Tumblr on the web. Here’s a smattering of goodies in the update:
Dark mode is now available on the web! Along with a few other color schemes, too. Just click the silhouette figure in the upper right corner and then click “Change Palette” to cycle through all of ‘em.
You can now view your likes page in the default view or in the new grid view.
Same with any tagged pages. Here, try it out with the frog tag. A glorious grid.
Copying the link to a post, reporting a post, or blocking someone whose content you don’t enjoy is easier than ever. Just click the meatballs menu (●●●)  in the upper right corner.
Some of these visual changes are obvious, but the biggest transformation is the one you can’t see. This wasn’t just a facelift, we completely updated the web interface. The old one was outdated—over a decade old. Adding features to it wasn’t always easy, fixing bugs wasn’t always quick. It was clear that we needed to update the whole dang thing. So update the whole dang thing we did. The result? A faster Tumblr. The experience is smoother, it’s easier to add new features, and we’re able to squash any pesky bugs quicker than before.

Hi there! Your friendly neighborhood Tumblr web developer here. You may have recently noticed that we’re making some changes around the site. Some of you might have even gotten the chance to play around with a beta version of our site on desktop. We may be biased, but we think it’s pretty neat!
However, we know that a lot of you don’t just use Tumblr—especially on your non-mobile devices. You use Tumblr and something. Tumblr and XKit, Tumblr and Tumblr Savior, Tumblr and all kinds of things, all of them made and maintained by passionate Tumblr users. We don’t want that to go away when we roll out the new changes to everybody.
We’ll be rolling out these changes within the next couple of months, aiming to be fully out by the end of March. So, consider this an olive branch–we don’t want this to surprise anyone, and we want to help everyone be ready.
Some of you are already digging into the beta site, poking at its gears, and trying to make it play along nicely with browser extensions. We want to make that at least somewhat easier. We’ve already built in one hook that lets you access consistent and meaningful CSS class names. Hopefully, that’s enough to enable some DOM manipulation and restyling. You can take a look at some documentation for it here.
It might not be enough for everything, though. If it’s not, we want to know. You can let us know via this very blog if you wish. Or drop by our docs on Github and leave an issue. We can’t make any guarantees, except that we’re listening.
All the best,

2025-12-05T07:00:28.925189,"I’ve been at Tumblr for four years as of last month, and in those four years I’ve moved from Engineer to Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer. Everyone’s journey along the path of their career is different, and engineering is a little different everywhere, but this is my story. My hope is that it provides some insight into Tumblr’s career ladder and some themes that are universal across engineering cultures at other companies.
Prelude: Full Stack Madness
Before I joined Tumblr, I worked for ten (!!!) years as a full stack developer at a college, mostly alone. I’d been writing code (poorly) and immersing myself in tech since I was a kid, so I felt pretty confident as a teenager taking a job building websites for my college.
Over the course of that ten-year job, I went from writing terrible PHP and Javascript to performing the ultra full stack of work: rack-mounting servers, installing operating systems on them, splitting them up into application servers and database servers and whatnot, managing them often, writing application logic to run on and across them, designing databases (relational and NoSQL), designing user interfaces, bridging lots of different APIs, and scaling my applications to meet greater demands. Way too much for one person to do, really.
It was an opportunity for me to get my hands on all facets of building things for the internet. It afforded ample time to figure out what felt best for me, which turned out to be backend application development. I probably waited way too long before moving on to my next job, which luckily became Tumblr. When I did get the job at Tumblr, I had two main goals: to work as a component of a team rather than alone, and to focus on backend engineering.
Being heads-down as an Engineer
When I joined Tumblr, I came on as an Engineer. It’s technically a step above “entry level” at most companies, and it was the baseline for new engineering hires at Tumblr at the time. Someone at the Engineer level at Tumblr is expected to be a team member who focuses on a certain technical domain, such as databases, SRE, iOS, Android, Javascript, PHP, Scala, etc. For me, in product engineering, this roughly translated into being either a frontend engineer (iOS, Android, Javascript) or a backend engineer (PHP, Scala). When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.
The Engineer level usually means you’re someone who is relatively “heads-down”, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on. That was me — at the time I joined we were working on finishing up the “new” post forms on the web, and my team was about to start building blog-to-blog instant messaging. I worked with senior engineers to flesh out the architecture for messaging, and through that I learned how to build something that seemed simple to me but became very complex at scale. I churned through a lot of tickets and wrote a lot of code, almost entirely feature logic, rarely touching anything outside of my domain.
While I didn’t spend a lot of time in meetings or making decisions, I did get to have a voice in pretty much everything my team worked on, and I felt empowered by my manager to speak my mind across the company. During my first year that actually got me in trouble, as I become a bit overconfident in my own opinion, and I didn’t have the experience necessary to back much of it up. That was a good learning experience for me; it taught me how to pick my battles and when to use my voice and speak my mind. Sometimes saying nothing is the best option, and it’s important to keep yourself mindful of what your voice is actually contributing.
Opening up avenues into Senior Engineering
After my first year I started feeling very familiar with Tumblr’s engineering practices and a couple of lucky opportunities appeared. The first was being asked to act as a pseudo-member of the Core PHP team since they were understaffed, which broadened my responsibilities and gave me a reason to start digging around in our framework-level code. It afforded me time to learn a lot about our framework level and our design patterns, and I made some fundamental changes to how the Tumblr PHP app works. More importantly, it almost doubled the amount of code I was expected to review, much of it outside of my previous work as a product engineer.
Around that time, the senior engineers I was working with on messaging moved on from the project, leaving pretty much just me to finish the work a few months before we launched. Because of this, almost all of the PHP logic that exists for messaging on Tumblr is my code, and I became the go-to authority on how messaging works under the hood.
After launch, we continued to iterate on messaging features. A few of these iterations required heavy refactors of a system that was humming along, being used by millions of people. I learned how to make dramatic changes without anyone who was using the product noticing, and I started being one of the engineers who’d help others do the same for their projects.
One example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it’d be like to lead cross-team efforts.
I also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents — at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr’s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn’t afraid to get my hands dirty.
All of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.
Raising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer
As a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me. The feeling of being uncomfortable became comfortable for me; I got used to being in a position where I didn’t have a ready solution to a problem, and I was happy to say so, but I felt confident I could figure it out by drawing on my past experience and doing some research.
I started being consulted by other teams when they’d be scoping out new projects, and I had a good sense for why a project could be difficult or easy. I also started going to meetings that had nothing to do with my normal job responsibilities, as I felt that it was important to stay on top of what was happening outside of those responsibilities. With only a couple hundred people at the company, it felt very feasible to know what was going on in most places.
It was around a year into being a Senior Engineer that I was invited to become a Staff Engineer, which at the time was parallel with the Senior Engineer role, having only a slightly different set of expectations. Being a Staff Engineer meant more talking about engineering problems and processes, more reviewing other peoples’ code and ideas, less time writing my own code. Usually this is actually its own dedicated step along the career path, as it typically means you’re some kind of dedicated domain owner in a much larger organization of engineers. I fell into it naturally, as I was already doing a lot of the kind of work it expected, which highlighted to me that the best career moves are often the obvious ones.
However, over time it began to feel like Staff Engineer was a role that would be more practical at a larger company of hundreds or thousands of engineers, and actually impractical at Tumblr’s size of just a hundred or so engineers. To me, many of the responsibilities of our Staff Engineer group felt like they should be that of any Senior Engineer or Managers/Directors. Many of our tasks involved shepherding other engineers and providing insight into how to fix hard problems, and defining processes that affected most engineers.
A lot of those processes were very administrative and felt like they’d be more enforceable if they came from someone at the executive level. At times, Staff Engineering also felt like the dreaded “ivory tower” approach to engineering, in which a select few get to decide what’s best for everyone, which I strongly disagree with. I hopped out of the Staff Engineer role after nine months or so, and the Staff Engineering group was dissolved shortly after I left it.
Becoming More Independent
After spending so much time spreading myself around the company, I gradually shifted out of being tied to a single team and I became a kind of “floater” among the product engineering teams. I started tackling bigger problems with our legacy systems (such as getting them GDPR compliant) and helping shape the architecture of new features (such as the Neue Post Format). I had become the same kind of engineer as those who had helped me build messaging, acting more as someone who isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty contending with the obscure parts of a ten year old codebase. It was around this time that I wrote How I Code Now and How I Review Code, as a lot of my job felt like it was honing those skills to a sharp point.
As I became a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer, more of my work became self-directed rather than decided for me by a supervisor. Instead of being given tickets to solve in a sprint, I got to do a combination of choosing my own work and being asked to help in certain areas by other managers and my supervisor. I went wherever that focus was needed, which still meant more time talking about problems, but now also more time writing framework code in support of other engineers.
After gaining a lot of experience in how Tumblr worked, it became easier for me to see where there were opportunities for improvement, both engineering- and product-wise. Since most of my passion is in the product work, I was given the latitude to try to push forward Tumblr’s product features more directly. Some of these projects I ran with myself, like the last three years of April Fools jokes and revamping Tumblrbot and pushing the Neue Post Format, but a lot of the time I’ve tried to help empower feature work that I’m just passionate about and want to see succeed.
Since I worked alone at my previous job for a very long time, I already had the ability to be self-directed and to self-organize. I try to keep my work well documented, I like to keep a trail of emails and tickets to show what I’m working on and have finished, and I can mentally context switch quickly between many different ongoing tasks. Most of that context switching ability centers around assigning priority to every task I do. If a project or task has no priority, it usually never gets done, but that’s fine; there is always more to do than can ever be done. Sometimes I have “rainy days” when I can pull something from the bottom of the priority list that I’ve wanted to do for awhile but not had time.
It was also around this time of becoming more self-directed that I began mentoring other engineers one-on-one, and working with them to help them grow in the same way that I had, or in whatever way they wanted to grow. Sometimes I join a specific team for a brief period, usually acting as a force-multiplier to the output of a team while I was on it. I like to tear through challenges and make big difficult decisions when they need to be made, talking and documenting them out to reinforce shared knowledge, while trying to avoid the pitfalls of seeking perfection. One example of that is the ongoing Neue Post Format project, which has involved huge refactors of existing code, tons of new code, and a complete overhaul of how all new posts on Tumblr are stored and represented. Not to mention thousands upon thousands of words of documentation.
All of this led me to becoming a Principal Engineer, which is where I’m at now. For me, it’s a role that expects continuous mentorship and sponsorship of other engineers, constant vigilance of best practices, tons and tons of code review and architecture-building, and heightened mindfulness of ones’ words and actions. In my experience so far, it’s a lot of talking and writing about engineering while making big, difficult engineering decisions, and actually writing fewer, but higher impact, lines of code.
Moving beyond Principal Engineer is a difficult and rare task. Of the hundred or so engineers at Tumblr, there are only a handful of Principal Engineers, and even fewer Senior Principals. From my understanding, moving beyond Principal at Tumblr means being a framework-level domain owner and decision maker, contributing to the entire scale of Tumblr’s success. I’m still trying to figure out if that challenge is something that interests me, but in the meantime there are more than enough challenges at Tumblr to keep me busy.

2025-12-05T07:00:28.970290,"I’ve been at Tumblr for four years as of last month, and in those four years I’ve moved from Engineer to Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer. Everyone’s journey along the path of their career is different, and engineering is a little different everywhere, but this is my story. My hope is that it provides some insight into Tumblr’s career ladder and some themes that are universal across engineering cultures at other companies.
Prelude: Full Stack Madness
Before I joined Tumblr, I worked for ten (!!!) years as a full stack developer at a college, mostly alone. I’d been writing code (poorly) and immersing myself in tech since I was a kid, so I felt pretty confident as a teenager taking a job building websites for my college.
Over the course of that ten-year job, I went from writing terrible PHP and Javascript to performing the ultra full stack of work: rack-mounting servers, installing operating systems on them, splitting them up into application servers and database servers and whatnot, managing them often, writing application logic to run on and across them, designing databases (relational and NoSQL), designing user interfaces, bridging lots of different APIs, and scaling my applications to meet greater demands. Way too much for one person to do, really.
It was an opportunity for me to get my hands on all facets of building things for the internet. It afforded ample time to figure out what felt best for me, which turned out to be backend application development. I probably waited way too long before moving on to my next job, which luckily became Tumblr. When I did get the job at Tumblr, I had two main goals: to work as a component of a team rather than alone, and to focus on backend engineering.
Being heads-down as an Engineer
When I joined Tumblr, I came on as an Engineer. It’s technically a step above “entry level” at most companies, and it was the baseline for new engineering hires at Tumblr at the time. Someone at the Engineer level at Tumblr is expected to be a team member who focuses on a certain technical domain, such as databases, SRE, iOS, Android, Javascript, PHP, Scala, etc. For me, in product engineering, this roughly translated into being either a frontend engineer (iOS, Android, Javascript) or a backend engineer (PHP, Scala). When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.
The Engineer level usually means you’re someone who is relatively “heads-down”, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on. That was me — at the time I joined we were working on finishing up the “new” post forms on the web, and my team was about to start building blog-to-blog instant messaging. I worked with senior engineers to flesh out the architecture for messaging, and through that I learned how to build something that seemed simple to me but became very complex at scale. I churned through a lot of tickets and wrote a lot of code, almost entirely feature logic, rarely touching anything outside of my domain.
While I didn’t spend a lot of time in meetings or making decisions, I did get to have a voice in pretty much everything my team worked on, and I felt empowered by my manager to speak my mind across the company. During my first year that actually got me in trouble, as I become a bit overconfident in my own opinion, and I didn’t have the experience necessary to back much of it up. That was a good learning experience for me; it taught me how to pick my battles and when to use my voice and speak my mind. Sometimes saying nothing is the best option, and it’s important to keep yourself mindful of what your voice is actually contributing.
Opening up avenues into Senior Engineering
After my first year I started feeling very familiar with Tumblr’s engineering practices and a couple of lucky opportunities appeared. The first was being asked to act as a pseudo-member of the Core PHP team since they were understaffed, which broadened my responsibilities and gave me a reason to start digging around in our framework-level code. It afforded me time to learn a lot about our framework level and our design patterns, and I made some fundamental changes to how the Tumblr PHP app works. More importantly, it almost doubled the amount of code I was expected to review, much of it outside of my previous work as a product engineer.
Around that time, the senior engineers I was working with on messaging moved on from the project, leaving pretty much just me to finish the work a few months before we launched. Because of this, almost all of the PHP logic that exists for messaging on Tumblr is my code, and I became the go-to authority on how messaging works under the hood.
After launch, we continued to iterate on messaging features. A few of these iterations required heavy refactors of a system that was humming along, being used by millions of people. I learned how to make dramatic changes without anyone who was using the product noticing, and I started being one of the engineers who’d help others do the same for their projects.
One example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it’d be like to lead cross-team efforts.
I also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents — at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr’s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn’t afraid to get my hands dirty.
All of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.
Raising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer
As a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me.

2025-12-05T07:00:29.058629,"I’ve been at Tumblr for four years as of last month, and in those four years I’ve moved from Engineer to Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer. Everyone’s journey along the path of their career is different, and engineering is a little different everywhere, but this is my story. My hope is that it provides some insight into Tumblr’s career ladder and some themes that are universal across engineering cultures at other companies.
Prelude: Full Stack Madness
Before I joined Tumblr, I worked for ten (!!!) years as a full stack developer at a college, mostly alone. I’d been writing code (poorly) and immersing myself in tech since I was a kid, so I felt pretty confident as a teenager taking a job building websites for my college.
Over the course of that ten-year job, I went from writing terrible PHP and Javascript to performing the ultra full stack of work: rack-mounting servers, installing operating systems on them, splitting them up into application servers and database servers and whatnot, managing them often, writing application logic to run on and across them, designing databases (relational and NoSQL), designing user interfaces, bridging lots of different APIs, and scaling my applications to meet greater demands. Way too much for one person to do, really.
It was an opportunity for me to get my hands on all facets of building things for the internet. It afforded ample time to figure out what felt best for me, which turned out to be backend application development. I probably waited way too long before moving on to my next job, which luckily became Tumblr. When I did get the job at Tumblr, I had two main goals: to work as a component of a team rather than alone, and to focus on backend engineering.
Being heads-down as an Engineer
When I joined Tumblr, I came on as an Engineer. It’s technically a step above “entry level” at most companies, and it was the baseline for new engineering hires at Tumblr at the time. Someone at the Engineer level at Tumblr is expected to be a team member who focuses on a certain technical domain, such as databases, SRE, iOS, Android, Javascript, PHP, Scala, etc. For me, in product engineering, this roughly translated into being either a frontend engineer (iOS, Android, Javascript) or a backend engineer (PHP, Scala). When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.
The Engineer level usually means you’re someone who is relatively “heads-down”, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on. That was me — at the time I joined we were working on finishing up the “new” post forms on the web, and my team was about to start building blog-to-blog instant messaging. I worked with senior engineers to flesh out the architecture for messaging, and through that I learned how to build something that seemed simple to me but became very complex at scale. I churned through a lot of tickets and wrote a lot of code, almost entirely feature logic, rarely touching anything outside of my domain.
While I didn’t spend a lot of time in meetings or making decisions, I did get to have a voice in pretty much everything my team worked on, and I felt empowered by my manager to speak my mind across the company. During my first year that actually got me in trouble, as I become a bit overconfident in my own opinion, and I didn’t have the experience necessary to back much of it up. That was a good learning experience for me; it taught me how to pick my battles and when to use my voice and speak my mind. Sometimes saying nothing is the best option, and it’s important to keep yourself mindful of what your voice is actually contributing.
Opening up avenues into Senior Engineering
After my first year I started feeling very familiar with Tumblr’s engineering practices and a couple of lucky opportunities appeared. The first was being asked to act as a pseudo-member of the Core PHP team since they were understaffed, which broadened my responsibilities and gave me a reason to start digging around in our framework-level code. It afforded me time to learn a lot about our framework level and our design patterns, and I made some fundamental changes to how the Tumblr PHP app works. More importantly, it almost doubled the amount of code I was expected to review, much of it outside of my previous work as a product engineer.
Around that time, the senior engineers I was working with on messaging moved on from the project, leaving pretty much just me to finish the work a few months before we launched. Because of this, almost all of the PHP logic that exists for messaging on Tumblr is my code, and I became the go-to authority on how messaging works under the hood.
After launch, we continued to iterate on messaging features. A few of these iterations required heavy refactors of a system that was humming along, being used by millions of people. I learned how to make dramatic changes without anyone who was using the product noticing, and I started being one of the engineers who’d help others do the same for their projects.
One example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it’d be like to lead cross-team efforts.
I also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents — at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr’s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn’t afraid to get my hands dirty.
All of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.
Raising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer
As a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me. The feeling of being uncomfortable became comfortable for me; I got used to being in a position where I didn’t have a ready solution to a problem, and I was happy to say so, but I felt confident I could figure it out by drawing on my past experience and doing some research.
I started being consulted by other teams when they’d be scoping out new projects, and I had a good sense for why a project could be difficult or easy. I also started going to meetings that had nothing to do with my normal job responsibilities, as I felt that it was important to stay on top of what was happening outside of those responsibilities. With only a couple hundred people at the company, it felt very feasible to know what was going on in most places.
It was around a year into being a Senior Engineer that I was invited to become a Staff Engineer, which at the time was parallel with the Senior Engineer role, having only a slightly different set of expectations. Being a Staff Engineer meant more talking about engineering problems and processes, more reviewing other peoples’ code and ideas, less time writing my own code. Usually this is actually its own dedicated step along the career path, as it typically means you’re some kind of dedicated domain owner in a much larger organization of engineers. I fell into it naturally, as I was already doing a lot of the kind of work it expected, which highlighted to me that the best career moves are often the obvious ones.
However, over time it began to feel like Staff Engineer was a role that would be more practical at a larger company of hundreds or thousands of engineers, and actually impractical at Tumblr’s size of just a hundred or so engineers. To me, many of the responsibilities of our Staff Engineer group felt like they should be that of any Senior Engineer or Managers/Directors. Many of our tasks involved shepherding other engineers and providing insight into how to fix hard problems, and defining processes that affected most engineers.
A lot of those processes were very administrative and felt like they’d be more enforceable if they came from someone at the executive level. At times, Staff Engineering also felt like the dreaded “ivory tower” approach to engineering, in which a select few get to decide what’s best for everyone, which I strongly disagree with. I hopped out of the Staff Engineer role after nine months or so, and the Staff Engineering group was dissolved shortly after I left it.
Becoming More Independent
After spending so much time spreading myself around the company, I gradually shifted out of being tied to a single team and I became a kind of “floater” among the product engineering teams. I started tackling bigger problems with our legacy systems (such as getting them GDPR compliant) and helping shape the architecture of new features (such as the Neue Post Format). I had become the same kind of engineer as those who had helped me build messaging, acting more as someone who isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty contending with the obscure parts of a ten year old codebase. It was around this time that I wrote How I Code Now and How I Review Code, as a lot of my job felt like it was honing those skills to a sharp point.
As I became a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer, more of my work became self-directed rather than decided for me by a supervisor. Instead of being given tickets to solve in a sprint, I got to do a combination of choosing my own work and being asked to help in certain areas by other managers and my supervisor. I went wherever that focus was needed, which still meant more time talking about problems, but now also more time writing framework code in support of other engineers.
After gaining a lot of experience in how Tumblr worked, it became easier for me to see where there were opportunities for improvement, both engineering- and product-wise. Since most of my passion is in the product work, I was given the latitude to try to push forward Tumblr’s product features more directly. Some of these projects I ran with myself, like the last three years of April Fools jokes and revamping Tumblrbot and pushing the Neue Post Format, but a lot of the time I’ve tried to help empower feature work that I’m just passionate about and want to see succeed.
Since I worked alone at my previous job for a very long time, I already had the ability to be self-directed and to self-organize. I try to keep my work well documented, I like to keep a trail of emails and tickets to show what I’m working on and have finished, and I can mentally context switch quickly between many different ongoing tasks. Most of that context switching ability centers around assigning priority to every task I do. If a project or task has no priority, it usually never gets done, but that’s fine; there is always more to do than can ever be done. Sometimes I have “rainy days” when I can pull something from the bottom of the priority list that I’ve wanted to do for awhile but not had time.
It was also around this time of becoming more self-directed that I began mentoring other engineers one-on-one, and working with them to help them grow in the same way that I had, or in whatever way they wanted to grow. Sometimes I join a specific team for a brief period, usually acting as a force-multiplier to the output of a team while I was on it. I like to tear through challenges and make big difficult decisions when they need to be made, talking and documenting them out to reinforce shared knowledge, while trying to avoid the pitfalls of seeking perfection. One example of that is the ongoing Neue Post Format project, which has involved huge refactors of existing code, tons of new code, and a complete overhaul of how all new posts on Tumblr are stored and represented. Not to mention thousands upon thousands of words of documentation.
All of this led me to becoming a Principal Engineer, which is where I’m at now. For me, it’s a role that expects continuous mentorship and sponsorship of other engineers, constant vigilance of best practices, tons and tons of code review and architecture-building, and heightened mindfulness of ones’ words and actions. In my experience so far, it’s a lot of talking and writing about engineering while making big, difficult engineering decisions, and actually writing fewer, but higher impact, lines of code.
Moving beyond Principal Engineer is a difficult and rare task. Of the hundred or so engineers at Tumblr, there are only a handful of Principal Engineers, and even fewer Senior Principals. From my understanding, moving beyond Principal at Tumblr means being a framework-level domain owner and decision maker, contributing to the entire scale of Tumblr’s success. I’m still trying to figure out if that challenge is something that interests me, but in the meantime there are more than enough challenges at Tumblr to keep me busy.

One example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it’d be like to lead cross-team efforts.
I also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents — at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr’s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn’t afraid to get my hands dirty.
All of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.
Raising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer
As a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me. The feeling of being uncomfortable became comfortable for me; I got used to being in a position where I didn’t have a ready solution to a problem, and I was happy to say so, but I felt confident I could figure it out by drawing on my past experience and doing some research.
I started being consulted by other teams when they’d be scoping out new projects, and I had a good sense for why a project could be difficult or easy. I also started going to meetings that had nothing to do with my normal job responsibilities, as I felt that it was important to stay on top of what was happening outside of those responsibilities. With only a couple hundred people at the company, it felt very feasible to know what was going on in most places.
It was around a year into being a Senior Engineer that I was invited to become a Staff Engineer, which at the time was parallel with the Senior Engineer role, having only a slightly different set of expectations. Being a Staff Engineer meant more talking about engineering problems and processes, more reviewing other peoples’ code and ideas, less time writing my own code. Usually this is actually its own dedicated step along the career path, as it typically means you’re some kind of dedicated domain owner in a much larger organization of engineers. I fell into it naturally, as I was already doing a lot of the kind of work it expected, which highlighted to me that the best career moves are often the obvious ones.
However, over time it began to feel like Staff Engineer was a role that would be more practical at a larger company of hundreds or thousands of engineers, and actually impractical at Tumblr’s size of just a hundred or so engineers. To me, many of the responsibilities of our Staff Engineer group felt like they should be that of any Senior Engineer or Managers/Directors. Many of our tasks involved shepherding other engineers and providing insight into how to fix hard problems, and defining processes that affected most engineers.
A lot of those processes were very administrative and felt like they’d be more enforceable if they came from someone at the executive level. At times, Staff Engineering also felt like the dreaded “ivory tower” approach to engineering, in which a select few get to decide what’s best for everyone, which I strongly disagree with. I hopped out of the Staff Engineer role after nine months or so, and the Staff Engineering group was dissolved shortly after I left it.
Becoming More Independent
After spending so much time spreading myself around the company, I gradually shifted out of being tied to a single team and I became a kind of “floater” among the product engineering teams. I started tackling bigger problems with our legacy systems (such as getting them GDPR compliant) and helping shape the architecture of new features (such as the Neue Post Format). I had become the same kind of engineer as those who had helped me build messaging, acting more as someone who isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty contending with the obscure parts of a ten year old codebase. It was around this time that I wrote How I Code Now and How I Review Code, as a lot of my job felt like it was honing those skills to a sharp point.
As I became a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer, more of my work became self-directed rather than decided for me by a supervisor. Instead of being given tickets to solve in a sprint, I got to do a combination of choosing my own work and being asked to help in certain areas by other managers and my supervisor. I went wherever that focus was needed, which still meant more time talking about problems, but now also more time writing framework code in support of other engineers.
After gaining a lot of experience in how Tumblr worked, it became easier for me to see where there were opportunities for improvement, both engineering- and product-wise. Since most of my passion is in the product work, I was given the latitude to try to push forward Tumblr’s product features more directly. Some of these projects I ran with myself, like the last three years of April Fools jokes and revamping Tumblrbot and pushing the Neue Post Format, but a lot of the time I’ve tried to help empower feature work that I’m just passionate about and want to see succeed.
Since I worked alone at my previous job for a very long time, I already had the ability to be self-directed and to self-organize. I try to keep my work well documented, I like to keep a trail of emails and tickets to show what I’m working on and have finished, and I can mentally context switch quickly between many different ongoing tasks. Most of that context switching ability centers around assigning priority to every task I do. If a project or task has no priority, it usually never gets done, but that’s fine; there is always more to do than can ever be done. Sometimes I have “rainy days” when I can pull something from the bottom of the priority list that I’ve wanted to do for awhile but not had time.
It was also around this time of becoming more self-directed that I began mentoring other engineers one-on-one, and working with them to help them grow in the same way that I had, or in whatever way they wanted to grow. Sometimes I join a specific team for a brief period, usually acting as a force-multiplier to the output of a team while I was on it. I like to tear through challenges and make big difficult decisions when they need to be made, talking and documenting them out to reinforce shared knowledge, while trying to avoid the pitfalls of seeking perfection. One example of that is the ongoing Neue Post Format project, which has involved huge refactors of existing code, tons of new code, and a complete overhaul of how all new posts on Tumblr are stored and represented. Not to mention thousands upon thousands of words of documentation.
All of this led me to becoming a Principal Engineer, which is where I’m at now. For me, it’s a role that expects continuous mentorship and sponsorship of other engineers, constant vigilance of best practices, tons and tons of code review and architecture-building, and heightened mindfulness of ones’ words and actions. In my experience so far, it’s a lot of talking and writing about engineering while making big, difficult engineering decisions, and actually writing fewer, but higher impact, lines of code.
Moving beyond Principal Engineer is a difficult and rare task. Of the hundred or so engineers at Tumblr, there are only a handful of Principal Engineers, and even fewer Senior Principals. From my understanding, moving beyond Principal at Tumblr means being a framework-level domain owner and decision maker, contributing to the entire scale of Tumblr’s success. I’m still trying to figure out if that challenge is something that interests me, but in the meantime there are more than enough challenges at Tumblr to keep me busy.

2025-12-05T07:00:31.341863,"How we wrote our own Service Worker
As we continue the process of reinvigorating Tumblr’s frontend web development, we’re always on the lookout for modern web technologies, especially ones that make our mobile site feel faster and more native. You could have guessed that we are making the mobile dashboard into a progressive app when we open-sourced our webpack plugin to make web app manifests back in August. And you would’ve been right. But to make a high quality progressive web app, you need more than just a web app manifest—you also need a service worker.
What is a service worker?
A service worker is a helper script that a page registers with the browser. After it is registered (some people like to also call it “installed”), the browser periodically checks the script for changes. If any part of the script contents changes, the browser reinstalls the updated script.
Service workers are most commonly used to intercept browser fetches and do various things with them. https://serviceworke.rs has a lot of great ideas about what you can do with service workers, with code examples. We decided to use our service worker to cache some JS, CSS, and font assets when it is installed, and to respond with those assets when the browser fetches any of them.
Using a service worker to precache assets
You might be wondering “why would you want to pre-cache assets when the service worker is installed? Isn’t that the same thing that the browser cache does?” While the browser cache does cache assets after they’re requested, our service worker can cache assets before they’re requested. This greatly speeds up parts of the page that we load in asynchronously, like the notes popover, or blogs that you tap into from the mobile dashboard.
While there are open-source projects that generate service workers to pre-cache your assets (like, for example, sw-precache), we chose to build our own service worker. When I started this project, I didn’t have any idea what service workers were, and I wanted to learn all about them. And what better way to learn about service workers than building one?
How our service worker is built
Because the service worker needs to know about all of the JS, CSS, and font assets in order to pre-cache them, we build a piece of the service worker during our build phase. This part of the service worker changes whenever our assets are updated. During the build step, we take a list of all of the assets that are output, filter them down into just the ones we want to pre-cache, and write them out to an array in a JS file that we call sw.js.
That service worker file importScripts()’s a separate file that contains all of our service worker functionality. All of the service worker functionality is built separately and written in TypeScript, but the file that contains all of our assets is plain JavaScript.
We decided to serve our service worker directly from our node.js app. Our other assets are served using CDNs. Because our CDN servers are often geographically closer to our users, our assets load faster from there than they do from our app. Using CDNs also keeps simple, asset-transfer traffic away from our app, which gives us space us to do more complicated things (like rendering your dashboard with React).
To keep asset traffic that reaches our app to a minimum, we tell our CDNs not to check back for updates to our assets for a long time. This is sometimes referred to as caching with a long TTL (time to live). As we know, cache-invalidation is a tough computer science problem, so we generate unique filenames based on the asset contents each time we build our assets. That way, when we request the new asset, we know that we’re going to get it because we use the new file name.
Because the browser wants to check back in with the service worker script to see if there are any changes, caching it in our CDNs is not a good fit. We would have to figure out how to do cache invalidation for that file, but none of the other assets. By serving that file directly from our node.js application, we get some additional asset-transfer traffic to our application but we think it’s worth it because it avoids all of the issues with caching.
How does it pre-cache assets?
When the service worker is installed, it compares the asset list in sw.js to the list of assets that it has in its cache. If an asset is in the cache, but not listed in sw.js, the asset gets deleted from the cache. If an asset is in sw.js, but not in the service worker cache, we download and cache it. If an asset is in sw.js and in the cache, it hasn’t changed, so we don’t need to do anything.
// in sw.js
self.ASSETS = [
  ‘main.js’,
  ‘notes-popover.js’,
  'favorit.woff’
];
// in service-worker.ts
self.addEventListener('install’, install);
const install = event => event.waitUntil(
  caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
    .then(cache => {
      const currentAssetList = self.ASSETS;
      const oldAssets =/* Instead of writing our own array diffing, we use lodash’s */;
      const newAssets =/* differenceBy() to figure out which assets are old and new */;
      return Promise.all([ …oldAssets.map(oldAsset => cache.delete(oldAsset)), cache.addAll(newAssets)]);
  });
);
We launched 🚀
Earlier this month, we launched the service worker to all users of our mobile web dashboard. Our performance instrumentation initially found a small performance regression, but we fixed it. Now our mobile web dashboard load time is about the same as before, but asynchronous bundles on the page load much faster.
We fixed the performance regression by improving performance of the service worker cache. Initially, we naively opened the service worker cache for every request. But now we only open the cache once, when the service worker starts running. Once the cache is opened, we attach listeners for fetch requests, and those closures capture the open cache in their scope.
// before
self.addEventListener('fetch’, handleFetch);
const handleFetch = event =>
  event.respondWith(
    caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
      .then(cache => cache.match(request)
      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch
        ? Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)
        : fetch(event.request)
      )
    )
  );
// now
caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
  .then(cache =>
    self.addEventListener('fetch’, handleFetch(cache));
const handleFetch = openCache => event =>
  event.respondWith(
    openCache.match(request)
      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch
        ? Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)
        : fetch(event.request)
      )
  );
Future plans
We have lots of future plans to make the service worker even better than it is now. In addition to pre-emptive caching, we would also like to do reactive caching, like the browser cache does. Every time an asset is requested that we do not already have in our cache, we could cache it. That will help keep the service worker cache fresh between installations.
We would also like to try building an API cache in our service worker, so that users can view some stale content while they’re waiting for new content to load. We could also leverage this cache if we built a service-worker-based offline mode. If you have any interest in service workers or ideas about how Tumblr could use them in the future, we would love to have you on our team.

When I started this project, I didn’t have any idea what service workers were, and I wanted to learn all about them. And what better way to learn about service workers than building one?
How our service worker is built
Because the service worker needs to know about all of the JS, CSS, and font assets in order to pre-cache them, we build a piece of the service worker during our build phase. This part of the service worker changes whenever our assets are updated. During the build step, we take a list of all of the assets that are output, filter them down into just the ones we want to pre-cache, and write them out to an array in a JS file that we call sw.js.
That service worker file importScripts()’s a separate file that contains all of our service worker functionality. All of the service worker functionality is built separately and written in TypeScript, but the file that contains all of our assets is plain JavaScript.
We decided to serve our service worker directly from our node.js app. Our other assets are served using CDNs. Because our CDN servers are often geographically closer to our users, our assets load faster from there than they do from our app. Using CDNs also keeps simple, asset-transfer traffic away from our app, which gives us space us to do more complicated things (like rendering your dashboard with React).
To keep asset traffic that reaches our app to a minimum, we tell our CDNs not to check back for updates to our assets for a long time. This is sometimes referred to as caching with a long TTL (time to live). As we know, cache-invalidation is a tough computer science problem, so we generate unique filenames based on the asset contents each time we build our assets. That way, when we request the new asset, we know that we’re going to get it because we use the new file name.
Because the browser wants to check back in with the service worker script to see if there are any changes, caching it in our CDNs is not a good fit. We would have to figure out how to do cache invalidation for that file, but none of the other assets. By serving that file directly from our node.js application, we get some additional asset-transfer traffic to our application but we think it’s worth it because it avoids all of the issues with caching.
How does it pre-cache assets?
When the service worker is installed, it compares the asset list in sw.js to the list of assets that it has in its cache. If an asset is in the cache, but not listed in sw.js, the asset gets deleted from the cache. If an asset is in sw.js, but not in the service worker cache, we download and cache it. If an asset is in sw.js and in the cache, it hasn’t changed, so we don’t need to do anything.
// in sw.js
self.ASSETS = [
  ‘main.js’,
  ‘notes-popover.js’,
  'favorit.woff’
];
// in service-worker.ts
self.addEventListener('install’, install);
const install = event => event.waitUntil(
  caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
    .then(cache => {
      const currentAssetList = self.ASSETS;
      const oldAssets =/* Instead of writing our own array diffing, we use lodash’s */;
      const newAssets =/* differenceBy() to figure out which assets are old and new */;
      return Promise.all([ …oldAssets.map(oldAsset => cache.delete(oldAsset)), cache.addAll(newAssets)]);
  });
);
We launched 🚀
Earlier this month, we launched the service worker to all users of our mobile web dashboard. Our performance instrumentation initially found a small performance regression, but we fixed it. Now our mobile web dashboard load time is about the same as before, but asynchronous bundles on the page load much faster.
We fixed the performance regression by improving performance of the service worker cache. Initially, we naively opened the service worker cache for every request. But now we only open the cache once, when the service worker starts running. Once the cache is opened, we attach listeners for fetch requests, and those closures capture the open cache in their scope.
// before
self.addEventListener('fetch’, handleFetch);
const handleFetch = event =>
  event.respondWith(
    caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
      .then(cache => cache.match(request)
      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch
        ? Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)
        : fetch(event.request)
      )
    )
  );
// now
caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
  .then(cache =>
    self.addEventListener('fetch’, handleFetch(cache));
const handleFetch = openCache => event =>
  event.respondWith(
    openCache.match(request)
      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch
        ? Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)
        : fetch(event.request)
      )
  );
Future plans
We have lots of future plans to make the service worker even better than it is now. In addition to pre-emptive caching, we would also like to do reactive caching, like the browser cache does. Every time an asset is requested that we do not already have in our cache, we could cache it. That will help keep the service worker cache fresh between installations.
We would also like to try building an API cache in our service worker, so that users can view some stale content while they’re waiting for new content to load. We could also leverage this cache if we built a service-worker-based offline mode. If you have any interest in service workers or ideas about how Tumblr could use them in the future, we would love to have you on our team.

2025-12-05T07:00:31.441672,"How we wrote our own Service Worker
As we continue the process of reinvigorating Tumblr’s frontend web development, we’re always on the lookout for modern web technologies, especially ones that make our mobile site feel faster and more native. You could have guessed that we are making the mobile dashboard into a progressive app when we open-sourced our webpack plugin to make web app manifests back in August. And you would’ve been right. But to make a high quality progressive web app, you need more than just a web app manifest—you also need a service worker.
What is a service worker?
A service worker is a helper script that a page registers with the browser. After it is registered (some people like to also call it “installed”), the browser periodically checks the script for changes. If any part of the script contents changes, the browser reinstalls the updated script.
Service workers are most commonly used to intercept browser fetches and do various things with them. https://serviceworke.rs has a lot of great ideas about what you can do with service workers, with code examples. We decided to use our service worker to cache some JS, CSS, and font assets when it is installed, and to respond with those assets when the browser fetches any of them.
Using a service worker to precache assets
You might be wondering “why would you want to pre-cache assets when the service worker is installed? Isn’t that the same thing that the browser cache does?” While the browser cache does cache assets after they’re requested, our service worker can cache assets before they’re requested.

You could have guessed that we are making the mobile dashboard into a progressive app when we open-sourced our webpack plugin to make web app manifests back in August. And you would’ve been right. But to make a high quality progressive web app, you need more than just a web app manifest—you also need a service worker.
What is a service worker?
A service worker is a helper script that a page registers with the browser. After it is registered (some people like to also call it “installed”), the browser periodically checks the script for changes. If any part of the script contents changes, the browser reinstalls the updated script.
Service workers are most commonly used to intercept browser fetches and do various things with them. https://serviceworke.rs has a lot of great ideas about what you can do with service workers, with code examples. We decided to use our service worker to cache some JS, CSS, and font assets when it is installed, and to respond with those assets when the browser fetches any of them.
Using a service worker to precache assets
You might be wondering “why would you want to pre-cache assets when the service worker is installed? Isn’t that the same thing that the browser cache does?” While the browser cache does cache assets after they’re requested, our service worker can cache assets before they’re requested. This greatly speeds up parts of the page that we load in asynchronously, like the notes popover, or blogs that you tap into from the mobile dashboard.
While there are open-source projects that generate service workers to pre-cache your assets (like, for example, sw-precache), we chose to build our own service worker. When I started this project, I didn’t have any idea what service workers were, and I wanted to learn all about them. And what better way to learn about service workers than building one?
How our service worker is built
Because the service worker needs to know about all of the JS, CSS, and font assets in order to pre-cache them, we build a piece of the service worker during our build phase. This part of the service worker changes whenever our assets are updated. During the build step, we take a list of all of the assets that are output, filter them down into just the ones we want to pre-cache, and write them out to an array in a JS file that we call sw.js.
That service worker file importScripts()’s a separate file that contains all of our service worker functionality. All of the service worker functionality is built separately and written in TypeScript, but the file that contains all of our assets is plain JavaScript.
We decided to serve our service worker directly from our node.js app. Our other assets are served using CDNs. Because our CDN servers are often geographically closer to our users, our assets load faster from there than they do from our app. Using CDNs also keeps simple, asset-transfer traffic away from our app, which gives us space us to do more complicated things (like rendering your dashboard with React).
To keep asset traffic that reaches our app to a minimum, we tell our CDNs not to check back for updates to our assets for a long time. This is sometimes referred to as caching with a long TTL (time to live). As we know, cache-invalidation is a tough computer science problem, so we generate unique filenames based on the asset contents each time we build our assets. That way, when we request the new asset, we know that we’re going to get it because we use the new file name.
Because the browser wants to check back in with the service worker script to see if there are any changes, caching it in our CDNs is not a good fit. We would have to figure out how to do cache invalidation for that file, but none of the other assets. By serving that file directly from our node.js application, we get some additional asset-transfer traffic to our application but we think it’s worth it because it avoids all of the issues with caching.
How does it pre-cache assets?
When the service worker is installed, it compares the asset list in sw.js to the list of assets that it has in its cache. If an asset is in the cache, but not listed in sw.js, the asset gets deleted from the cache. If an asset is in sw.js, but not in the service worker cache, we download and cache it. If an asset is in sw.js and in the cache, it hasn’t changed, so we don’t need to do anything.
// in sw.js
self.ASSETS = [
  ‘main.js’,
  ‘notes-popover.js’,
  'favorit.woff’
];
// in service-worker.ts
self.addEventListener('install’, install);
const install = event => event.waitUntil(
  caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
    .then(cache => {
      const currentAssetList = self.ASSETS;
      const oldAssets =/* Instead of writing our own array diffing, we use lodash’s */;
      const newAssets =/* differenceBy() to figure out which assets are old and new */;
      return Promise.all([ …oldAssets.map(oldAsset => cache.delete(oldAsset)), cache.addAll(newAssets)]);
  });
);
We launched 🚀
Earlier this month, we launched the service worker to all users of our mobile web dashboard. Our performance instrumentation initially found a small performance regression, but we fixed it. Now our mobile web dashboard load time is about the same as before, but asynchronous bundles on the page load much faster.
We fixed the performance regression by improving performance of the service worker cache. Initially, we naively opened the service worker cache for every request. But now we only open the cache once, when the service worker starts running. Once the cache is opened, we attach listeners for fetch requests, and those closures capture the open cache in their scope.
// before
self.addEventListener('fetch’, handleFetch);
const handleFetch = event =>
  event.respondWith(
    caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
      .then(cache => cache.match(request)
      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch
        ? Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)
        : fetch(event.request)
      )
    )
  );
// now
caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache’)
  .then(cache =>
    self.addEventListener('fetch’, handleFetch(cache));
const handleFetch = openCache => event =>
  event.respondWith(
    openCache.match(request)
      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch
        ? Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)
        : fetch(event.request)
      )
  );
Future plans
We have lots of future plans to make the service worker even better than it is now. In addition to pre-emptive caching, we would also like to do reactive caching, like the browser cache does. Every time an asset is requested that we do not already have in our cache, we could cache it. That will help keep the service worker cache fresh between installations.
We would also like to try building an API cache in our service worker, so that users can view some stale content while they’re waiting for new content to load. We could also leverage this cache if we built a service-worker-based offline mode. If you have any interest in service workers or ideas about how Tumblr could use them in the future, we would love to have you on our team.

Why?
Since we’re rewriting the web, we wanted to make sure we did so with accessibility in mind. I could give you a long description why, but plenty of articles explain better than I can. Put simply: the web should be made useable for everyone.
We began with using the accessibility auditing tool in Google Lighthouse to check the improvements that could be made. Initially, our score wasn’t that great: 62. If you factored in areas that need to be manually checked then our score would have been abysmal. However, we’ve made great strides since then and are on our way to achieving that coveted 💯
We had inaccessible menus and poorly described elements, among other things. Using a tool like VoiceOver or TalkBalk you can see what experiencing Tumblr on mobile web with a screen reader was like. Here’s a gif showing what the mobile web experience on Tumblr was like prior to the changes.
What we did
Some of the more noticeable improvements we made were introducing design changes to increase readability and making improvements following WAI-ARIA guidelines. We’ll walk through a few other changes we made using React.
Visual order on the page follows DOM order
One of the larger changes we made was to revamp modals and popovers (e.g., the post activity screen). Originally we used React Portals but it isn’t always the most friendly for accessibility. Ideally you want to have elements appear in logical DOM order and Portals provides a way to circumvent that. So, no more Portals!
The user’s focus is directed to new content added to the page
Next step was to provide a way to manage focus. We want to a) direct focus to the modal when it’s opened and b) return focus to the element that opened the fullscreen modal. Using React’s lifecycle methods and refs, this is simple enough to implement. In your modal component:
public targetEl: HTMLElement; // The element used to open the modal
public buttonEl: HTMLElement;
public componentDidMount() {
  // We add an event listener to get the element that opened the modal
  document.addEventListener(‘focus’, this.setOriginalTargetEl, true);
  // We set focus to some element inside your modal
  this.buttonEl.focus();
}
public componentWillUnmount() {
  // Return focus to the element that opened the modal
  if (this.targetEl) {
    this.targetEl.focus();
  }
}
public setOriginalTargetEl = event => {
  // Only set it once to get the initial target
  if (!this.targetEl) {
    this.targetEl = event.relatedTarget;
    document.removeEventListener('focus’, this.setOriginalTargetEl, true);
  }
};
public render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button ref={(el) => this.buttonEl = el}>
        Back
      </button>
      <div>Your content</div>
    </div>
  );
}
This can make navigation a lot easier.
Tada!
Of course, we’re still fine-tuning different elements of the site since accessibility is more than just a number. A lot of these changes will be even more noticeable when the new Tumblr dashboard comes to your desktop. There’s still more to come, so keep your eyes open!

  // Return focus to the element that opened the modal
  if (this.targetEl) {
    this.targetEl.focus();
  }
}
public setOriginalTargetEl = event => {
  // Only set it once to get the initial target
  if (!this.targetEl) {

  return (

        Back
      </button>
      <div>Your content</div>
    </div>
  );
}
This can make navigation a lot easier.
Tada!
Of course, we’re still fine-tuning different elements of the site since accessibility is more than just a number. A lot of these changes will be even more noticeable when the new Tumblr dashboard comes to your desktop. There’s still more to come, so keep your eyes open!
Think there’s a way to make Tumblr more accessible? Hit us up at tumblr.com/jobs and come work with us!

We’re abnormally jazzed to announce some significant updates to our public API and its documentation:
Our Tumblr API documentation has moved to Github in Markdown format. It also includes a few new things here and there, like a section on newer and better Blog Unique Identifiers.
The Neue Post Format is now available for use via the Tumblr API when consuming or creating posts! You can now make posts using a JSON specification that’s easier to use than HTML and will be more extensible moving forward as we build new ways of posting.
The new public documentation on Github now includes the JSON specification of the Neue Post Format to help you consume NPF and create Posts using NPF. We aren’t currently planning to deprecate the “Legacy” posting flows (yet), but at some point in the future we won’t be able to guarantee that HTML posts will look as intended on all devices and platforms.
Work on the Neue Post Format is ongoing here at Tumblr as we make the posting experience better, more streamlined, and more exciting; any changes we make will be documented in our new public docs on Github. Watch our new public doc repository to find out when these changes happen!
You can pass along the query parameter ?npf=true to any Tumblr API endpoint that returns Posts to return those Posts in the Neue Post Format rather than the legacy Post format.

2025-12-05T07:00:33.018941,"Making a progressive web app with webpack just got a little bit easier
Today we are releasing webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin, which generates an app manifest that shows up in your assets manifest.
I heard you like manifests
Turns out, there are a lot of web things called “manifests”. When talking about web app manifests and assets manifests, sometimes it’s hard to keep track. Buckle up, because we made a webpack plugin that deals with both of these types of manifests.
Web app manifests are JSON files that allow your application to specify the way it should be treated when installed as an application on a mobile device. You may want to specify what the application name and icon should be. Maybe you want to tell the browser to tint some of its UI elements to match the color scheme of your page, or even hide the browser chrome entirely. You can do all of that with a web app manifest.
Assets manifests are JSON files that contain paths to assets that are generated by webpack. They’re generated by plugins such as assets-webpack-plugin. If you add hashes to the end of your filenames to allow cache busting, assets manifests can be very useful. For example, we use our assets manifest to add JavaScript and CSS files to our <script> and <link> tags.
So I put a manifest in your manifest
While we were building our web app manifest, we wanted to be able to add a hash to the file path and <link> to it. So we needed to add it to our assets manifest. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any existing open-source plugins that output the file in the correct way to add it to the app manifest. So, we built webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin.
By default, webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin assumes that you will name your icon files in the format manifest/icon_[square dimension].(png|jpeg|jpg). If you name them using that scheme, you can use this plugin just like this:
// in your webpack config
import AppManifestPlugin from ‘webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin’;

…

plugins: [
  new AppManifestPlugin({
    content: {
      name:'Tumblr’,
      short_name:'Tumblr’,
      background_color:’#36465d’,
    },
    destination: ’/manifest’,
  }),
],

…

// in your page template
const manifest = // however you usually access your asset manifest in code
const appManifestPath = manifest['app-manifest’].json;

<link rel=“manifest” href={appManifestPath} />
If you named your icons with some other naming scheme, you can still add them to the web app manifest, it’s just a little more work. That process is detailed in the README.
Please use it
We’re really proud of the work we’ve done to make web app manifests compatible with asset manifests, which is why we’ve decided to open source it and publish it on npm. Please use it.
If this plugin doesn’t meet your needs, we welcome pull requests. And if you have a passion for progressive web applications, webpack, and open source, join our team!

Unfortunately, we were unable to find any existing open-source plugins that output the file in the correct way to add it to the app manifest. So, we built webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin.
By default, webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin assumes that you will name your icon files in the format manifest/icon_[square dimension].(png|jpeg|jpg). If you name them using that scheme, you can use this plugin just like this:
// in your webpack config
import AppManifestPlugin from ‘webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin’;

…

plugins: [
  new AppManifestPlugin({
    content: {
      name:'Tumblr’,
      short_name:'Tumblr’,
      background_color:’#36465d’,
    },
    destination: ’/manifest’,
  }),
],

…

// in your page template
const manifest = // however you usually access your asset manifest in code
const appManifestPath = manifest['app-manifest’].json;

<link rel=“manifest” href={appManifestPath} />
If you named your icons with some other naming scheme, you can still add them to the web app manifest, it’s just a little more work. That process is detailed in the README.
Please use it
We’re really proud of the work we’ve done to make web app manifests compatible with asset manifests, which is why we’ve decided to open source it and publish it on npm. Please use it.
If this plugin doesn’t meet your needs, we welcome pull requests. And if you have a passion for progressive web applications, webpack, and open source, join our team!

Today we are releasing webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin, which generates an app manifest that shows up in your assets manifest.
I heard you like manifests
Turns out, there are a lot of web things called “manifests”. When talking about web app manifests and assets manifests, sometimes it’s hard to keep track. Buckle up, because we made a webpack plugin that deals with both of these types of manifests.
Web app manifests are JSON files that allow your application to specify the way it should be treated when installed as an application on a mobile device. You may want to specify what the application name and icon should be. Maybe you want to tell the browser to tint some of its UI elements to match the color scheme of your page, or even hide the browser chrome entirely. You can do all of that with a web app manifest.
Assets manifests are JSON files that contain paths to assets that are generated by webpack. They’re generated by plugins such as assets-webpack-plugin. If you add hashes to the end of your filenames to allow cache busting, assets manifests can be very useful. For example, we use our assets manifest to add JavaScript and CSS files to our <script> and <link> tags.

2025-12-05T07:00:33.511112,"A Breath of Life: Welcome the Brand New Mobile Web Dashboard
We rebuilt another piece of the site with React
Background
A few months ago my colleague Robbie wrote a post about how the Core Web team is introducing a new web stack built on Docker, Node, and React. It is a beautiful vision, but we had only launched one tiny page on that infrastructure. This spring, we used that new stack to rebuild the mobile web dashboard from the ground up. And then we launched it.
Why we did it
We decided on building the mobile dashboard next for a few reasons. First, the dashboard is one of the most important parts of Tumblr—for many people it is their primary window into the content here. Because of that, most things that we develop inevitably touch the dashboard. It was time to raise the stakes.
The desktop dashboard and the mobile apps have been moving forward at a blistering pace, but have you seen the mobile web dashboard? It was stuck in 2015. Nobody ever made features for it because it was a completely separate codebase. We avoided that issue with the rewrite. Since the new version we’re building is responsive, our new mobile web dashboard will eventually also power the desktop web dashboard experience. This’ll make it much easier to maintain feature parity between the desktop and mobile web experiences.
Finally, we wanted to make something a little bit more complex than the image page, and the mobile web dashboard seemed like a good next step. It allowed us to start making authenticated API calls and figuring out how to pass cookies through our new server to and from our API; to think about laying the groundwork for a totally responsive dashboard, so we can eventually launch this for the desktop; to make a testing ground for progressive web app features like web app manifests; to start rendering posts that are backed by the new post format; and to figure out how to slowly roll out the new stack to a consistent, small set of users. We also had a pretty bad performance bug and learned a whole lot about profiling Node. (We plan on writing more in-depth posts about some of these topics soon.)
It is good
And the rewrite turned out really well. Even with more features like pull-to-refresh, a new activity popover, and modern audio and video players, we sped up our DOM content loaded time by 35%! The new page has a lot of modern web standards in it too like srcsets, flexbox, asynchronous bundle loading, and a web app manifest. You can install the mobile web dashboard as a standalone app now. It was also way faster and simpler to write using React than it was on our old PHP/Backbone stack.
We’re really proud of the new mobile web dashboard. We look forward to bringing even more new features to it in the near future, and launching even more pages on our new web infrastructure.
If you think this is cool too, come work with us!

And the rewrite turned out really well. Even with more features like pull-to-refresh, a new activity popover, and modern audio and video players, we sped up our DOM content loaded time by 35%! The new page has a lot of modern web standards in it too like srcsets, flexbox, asynchronous bundle loading, and a web app manifest. You can install the mobile web dashboard as a standalone app now. It was also way faster and simpler to write using React than it was on our old PHP/Backbone stack.
We’re really proud of the new mobile web dashboard. We look forward to bringing even more new features to it in the near future, and launching even more pages on our new web infrastructure.
If you think this is cool too, come work with us!

2025-12-05T07:00:33.799263,"A Breath of Life: Welcome the Brand New Mobile Web Dashboard
We rebuilt another piece of the site with React
Background
A few months ago my colleague Robbie wrote a post about how the Core Web team is introducing a new web stack built on Docker, Node, and React. It is a beautiful vision, but we had only launched one tiny page on that infrastructure. This spring, we used that new stack to rebuild the mobile web dashboard from the ground up. And then we launched it.
Why we did it
We decided on building the mobile dashboard next for a few reasons. First, the dashboard is one of the most important parts of Tumblr—for many people it is their primary window into the content here. Because of that, most things that we develop inevitably touch the dashboard. It was time to raise the stakes.
The desktop dashboard and the mobile apps have been moving forward at a blistering pace, but have you seen the mobile web dashboard? It was stuck in 2015. Nobody ever made features for it because it was a completely separate codebase. We avoided that issue with the rewrite. Since the new version we’re building is responsive, our new mobile web dashboard will eventually also power the desktop web dashboard experience. This’ll make it much easier to maintain feature parity between the desktop and mobile web experiences.
Finally, we wanted to make something a little bit more complex than the image page, and the mobile web dashboard seemed like a good next step. It allowed us to start making authenticated API calls and figuring out how to pass cookies through our new server to and from our API; to think about laying the groundwork for a totally responsive dashboard, so we can eventually launch this for the desktop; to make a testing ground for progressive web app features like web app manifests; to start rendering posts that are backed by the new post format; and to figure out how to slowly roll out the new stack to a consistent, small set of users. We also had a pretty bad performance bug and learned a whole lot about profiling Node. (We plan on writing more in-depth posts about some of these topics soon.)
It is good
And the rewrite turned out really well. Even with more features like pull-to-refresh, a new activity popover, and modern audio and video players, we sped up our DOM content loaded time by 35%! The new page has a lot of modern web standards in it too like srcsets, flexbox, asynchronous bundle loading, and a web app manifest. You can install the mobile web dashboard as a standalone app now.

The event
Previously, we were only open to Tumblr employees. This year we decided to extend an invite out to the other teams housed under our parent company, Oath.
All participants had a three hour window to hack, a buffet of tacos, beer, and wine to dive into, and a stack of prizes for the top four players (see Prizes below for details)!
Challenges were available Jeopardy-style, broken down by category. We had eight fun categories to select from:
Auth Bypass (authn | authz)
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Crypto
Forensics
Reverse Engineering
SQL Injection (SQLi)
XML Injection (+ XXE)
We also sprinkled a few “inside joke” Easter eggs around the system that awarded bonus points to anyone that discovered them! For example, if they attempted to find a hole in the CTF system itself and navigated to /wp-admin, we’d give them a flag on a prank WordPress page; or perhaps testing to find XSS with a <marquee> tag — only the greatest of all XSS tags!
While the Security Team walked around and helped out, we also setup a mini lockpick village just because.

2025-12-05T07:00:34.503632,"If you’ve been following this Tumblr, you’ll likely know that we, the Core Web team, have recently started rewriting and modernizing the Tumblr web platform. This undertaking presents some incredibly exciting opportunities to innovate with lots of fun technologies. We’re working on improving every aspect of the web; the dashboard, the archive, the blog network, you name it.  
Are you a senior JavaScript engineer and wanna be a part of this adventure? Come join Core Web! You’ll help create the building blocks with which a brand new modern Tumblr will be built. Your work will directly impact and define the user experience for millions of users and the development tools for a large number of product engineers across several teams at Tumblr!

We’re looking for an extraordinary senior JavaScript engineer who wants to take on the following challenges:
Keep making our build and deployment more delightful and futuristic
Help establish norms and standards for how this new web client should be architected, including setting JavaScript, CSS, performance and other best-practices, and introducing/creating the tools to achieve them
Internally and externally raising awareness around the work the team is doing by being active in the Open-source and engineering community 
Whatever else you think will help us create the highest quality web platform and development experience!
Who we’re looking for
An ideal team member is someone with:
Strong JavaScript and CSS fundamentals
Experience setting up Continuous Integration / Continuous Deploys
Expertise in build tools like Webpack, Parcel (or similar)
Pragmatism and the ability to decide what’s “good enough” (while planning ahead and knowing when to iterate)
An ability to independently drive projects
A desire to innovate and bring new things into the world
An understanding of code quality, unit test coverage, and performance
Empathy and the desire to elevate those around them
The belief that work is just as much about the journey as the destination
Our current toolkit
Webpack
ES6
React and React Router
CSS Modules
TypeScript
Jenkins and Jenkins pipelines
Docker
Node and Express
Kubernetes
