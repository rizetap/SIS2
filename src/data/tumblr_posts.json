Well, @artfight is upon us, and the Fossils and Crystals are having it out by depicting each other's original characters\u2014so the answer is a lot of creechure.

    "post_text":"A better inclusive and accessible design\nApple has always focused on providing a great experience, from the presentations to what it proposes for the developers. On the second day of the WWDC21 event, a theme that keeps coming back is the importance of a more inclusive and accessible design on all of the different application scopes.\nIt can even be seen in the language that we use and look for reference, respecting different perspectives, adopting more accessibility features, making our design more inclusive, especially in the area of content that includes writing, images, audio, video, it can be seen everywhere... everything we use to \"talk\" to our audience. \ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3\nDespite being a topic of great importance, my main concern is that it makes us wonder if our products are in fact meeting these expectations as much as possible. \u2764\ufe0f\nBelow you can see the two sessions that talk more about it.\nThe practice of inclusive design - WWDC 2021 - Videos - Apple Developer\nAn inclusive app or game is not only usable by different people, but also welcomes people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives...\nAPPLE DEVELOPER\nThe process of inclusive design - WWDC 2021 - Videos - Apple Developer\nDiscover how you can deliver inclusive apps that can foster amazing experiences for everyone who uses your software. We'll take you...\nAPPLE DEVELOPER\nBringing more accessibility features \u2705\nDynamic type is not new. It's something that has been around since iOS 7, but its adoption by apps has been somewhat slow. Since iOS 11, Apple has been making significant improvements to the feature that should lead to wide-scale adoption.\nGetting a little more technical... \u2699\ufe0f\ud83d\udee0\nDynamic type supports up to seven size settings, but that's not the limit, for example, the body text style is 17pt in the default setting, but can range from 14pt to 23pt, and we can, in extreme cases count with the accessibility setting that supports even larger fonts up to 53pt for body text.\nMy mother \u2764\ufe0fis a great example of someone that is heavily dependent on this particular feature.

    "post_text":"Tumblr for a new user on iOS\nI have been using Tumblr for the past week, before that, I have never really jumped into it.\nMy first impression of the platform was that it was a more user choice-focused platform, kinda like Reddit. I got this impression from the Markdown and HTML editors that you can use to customize your blog and write posts. I was really impressed that a modern social media company still allowed the choice to edit custom HTML for blogs and a rich content editor for posts. However, this was all in the web interface\u2026\nWhen I opened the iPad app, I quickly realized that the app is nowhere near optimized for the iPad or any of Apple\u2019s newer technologies. In this post, I will be going over how I think Tumblr can take some of the new technologies Apple has released so far in WWDC and make their platform one of the most advanced social media on iOS.\nWhat I think Tumblr could improve upon\nThe iPad UI\nOther posts have touched a lot more on Tumblr\u2019s iPad UI so I will not go as in-depth as them. However I do have to say, it really needs improvement. Having one central post-column looks comical on an iPad and really ruins the look and feel of Tumblr. I think adapting to Apple\u2019s new multi-column layouts for iPad would be an amazing choice for Tumblr.\nSupporting new technologies like multi-column layouts would put Tumblr ahead of the competition. A lot of social media currently do not support iPad\u2019s as well as they could. They just show a scaled-up version of their mobile interface. This leads to a lot of annoyances about the iPad app. With a lot of people moving to iPad\u2019s as the main device, having an unoptimized iPad app will send people away from using Tumblr as their blogging platform.\nMultitasking\nApple so far has talked a lot about the new iPad multitasking features. Now there isn\u2019t really much at all that has been added, it is just way more discoverable than before. With more discoverability comes more users looking to use it in their favorite apps.\nWhen I tried to use Tumblr in a multitasking manner, it just fails to work. There is no way to have multiple windows of the app, and when it is in split-screen the UI fails to adapt well. I believe adding support for iPad\u2019s new multitasking features will allow Tumblr to fly ahead of other social media at a user experience level. On Apple devices, Everything Just Works. And for the Tumblr app and multitasking, it doesn\u2019t. New and returning users will look to use multitasking and then learn that it is not supported, leaving them a little disappointed. I think supporting features like these are essential for Tumblr to thrive in the growing social media space.\nShortcuts Support\nA lot of my time is spent using and creating Shortcuts. I really wish that Tumblr had a lot more support for Shortcuts. Currently, Tumblr has one action, and you need to login into that action inside the Shortcuts app. Even if you are logged into the Tumblr app on your device. I think that improved support for Shortcuts will be necessary for the future for any app on an Apple Platform. Doing simple things: like opening a specific blog, or going to your favorite creator\u2019s page, should all be doable through Shortcuts actions. Apple has been putting a lot of time and development into Shortcuts, and I really believe that Tumblr should integrate as well as it can into the Shortcut ecosystem.\nIn Total\nI believe that Tumblr should look into supporting more of iOS\u2019s power-user features. These features will bring more people to the platform. It also makes Tumblr a good model candidate for an iOS social media app.",

    "post_text":"Tumblr for a new user on iOS\nI have been using Tumblr for the past week, before that, I have never really jumped into it.\nMy first impression of the platform was that it was a more user choice-focused platform, kinda like Reddit. I got this impression from the Markdown and HTML editors that you can use to customize your blog and write posts. I was really impressed that a modern social media company still allowed the choice to edit custom HTML for blogs and a rich content editor for posts. However, this was all in the web interface\u2026\nWhen I opened the iPad app, I quickly realized that the app is nowhere near optimized for the iPad or any of Apple\u2019s newer technologies. In this post, I will be going over how I think Tumblr can take some of the new technologies Apple has released so far in WWDC and make their platform one of the most advanced social media on iOS.\nWhat I think Tumblr could improve upon\nThe iPad UI\nOther posts have touched a lot more on Tumblr\u2019s iPad UI so I will not go as in-depth as them. However I do have to say, it really needs improvement. Having one central post-column looks comical on an iPad and really ruins the look and feel of Tumblr. I think adapting to Apple\u2019s new multi-column layouts for iPad would be an amazing choice for Tumblr.\nSupporting new technologies like multi-column layouts would put Tumblr ahead of the competition. A lot of social media currently do not support iPad\u2019s as well as they could. They just show a scaled-up version of their mobile interface. This leads to a lot of annoyances about the iPad app. With a lot of people moving to iPad\u2019s as the main device, having an unoptimized iPad app will send people away from using Tumblr as their blogging platform.\nMultitasking\nApple so far has talked a lot about the new iPad multitasking features. Now there isn\u2019t really much at all that has been added, it is just way more discoverable than before. With more discoverability comes more users looking to use it in their favorite apps.\nWhen I tried to use Tumblr in a multitasking manner, it just fails to work. There is no way to have multiple windows of the app, and when it is in split-screen the UI fails to adapt well. I believe adding support for iPad\u2019s new multitasking features will allow Tumblr to fly ahead of other social media at a user experience level. On Apple devices, Everything Just Works.

We may be biased, but we think it\u2019s pretty neat!\nHowever, we know that a lot of you don\u2019t just use Tumblr\u2014especially on your non-mobile devices. You use Tumblr and something.

    "post_text":"I\u2019ve been at Tumblr for four years as of last month, and in those four years I\u2019ve moved from Engineer to Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer. Everyone\u2019s journey along the path of their career is different, and engineering is a little different everywhere, but this is my story. My hope is that it provides some insight into Tumblr\u2019s career ladder and some themes that are universal across engineering cultures at other companies.\nPrelude: Full Stack Madness\nBefore I joined Tumblr, I worked for ten (!!!) years as a full stack developer at a college, mostly alone. I\u2019d been writing code (poorly) and immersing myself in tech since I was a kid, so I felt pretty confident as a teenager taking a job building websites for my college.\nOver the course of that ten-year job, I went from writing terrible PHP and Javascript to performing the ultra full stack of work: rack-mounting servers, installing operating systems on them, splitting them up into application servers and database servers and whatnot, managing them often, writing application logic to run on and across them, designing databases (relational and NoSQL), designing user interfaces, bridging lots of different APIs, and scaling my applications to meet greater demands. Way too much for one person to do, really.\nIt was an opportunity for me to get my hands on all facets of building things for the internet. It afforded ample time to figure out what felt best for me, which turned out to be backend application development. I probably waited way too long before moving on to my next job, which luckily became Tumblr. When I did get the job at Tumblr, I had two main goals: to work as a component of a team rather than alone, and to focus on backend engineering.\nBeing heads-down as an Engineer\nWhen I joined Tumblr, I came on as an Engineer. It\u2019s technically a step above \u201centry level\u201d at most companies, and it was the baseline for new engineering hires at Tumblr at the time. Someone at the Engineer level at Tumblr is expected to be a team member who focuses on a certain technical domain, such as databases, SRE, iOS, Android, Javascript, PHP, Scala, etc. For me, in product engineering, this roughly translated into being either a frontend engineer (iOS, Android, Javascript) or a backend engineer (PHP, Scala). When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.\nThe Engineer level usually means you\u2019re someone who is relatively \u201cheads-down\u201d, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on. That was me \u2014 at the time I joined we were working on finishing up the \u201cnew\u201d post forms on the web, and my team was about to start building blog-to-blog instant messaging. I worked with senior engineers to flesh out the architecture for messaging, and through that I learned how to build something that seemed simple to me but became very complex at scale. I churned through a lot of tickets and wrote a lot of code, almost entirely feature logic, rarely touching anything outside of my domain.\nWhile I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in meetings or making decisions, I did get to have a voice in pretty much everything my team worked on, and I felt empowered by my manager to speak my mind across the company. During my first year that actually got me in trouble, as I become a bit overconfident in my own opinion, and I didn\u2019t have the experience necessary to back much of it up. That was a good learning experience for me; it taught me how to pick my battles and when to use my voice and speak my mind. Sometimes saying nothing is the best option, and it\u2019s important to keep yourself mindful of what your voice is actually contributing.\nOpening up avenues into Senior Engineering\nAfter my first year I started feeling very familiar with Tumblr\u2019s engineering practices and a couple of lucky opportunities appeared. The first was being asked to act as a pseudo-member of the Core PHP team since they were understaffed, which broadened my responsibilities and gave me a reason to start digging around in our framework-level code. It afforded me time to learn a lot about our framework level and our design patterns, and I made some fundamental changes to how the Tumblr PHP app works. More importantly, it almost doubled the amount of code I was expected to review, much of it outside of my previous work as a product engineer.\nAround that time, the senior engineers I was working with on messaging moved on from the project, leaving pretty much just me to finish the work a few months before we launched. Because of this, almost all of the PHP logic that exists for messaging on Tumblr is my code, and I became the go-to authority on how messaging works under the hood.\nAfter launch, we continued to iterate on messaging features. A few of these iterations required heavy refactors of a system that was humming along, being used by millions of people. I learned how to make dramatic changes without anyone who was using the product noticing, and I started being one of the engineers who\u2019d help others do the same for their projects.\nOne example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it\u2019d be like to lead cross-team efforts.\nI also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents \u2014 at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr\u2019s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn\u2019t afraid to get my hands dirty.\nAll of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.\nRaising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer\nAs a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me. The feeling of being uncomfortable became comfortable for me; I got used to being in a position where I didn\u2019t have a ready solution to a problem, and I was happy to say so, but I felt confident I could figure it out by drawing on my past experience and doing some research.\nI started being consulted by other teams when they\u2019d be scoping out new projects, and I had a good sense for why a project could be difficult or easy. I also started going to meetings that had nothing to do with my normal job responsibilities, as I felt that it was important to stay on top of what was happening outside of those responsibilities. With only a couple hundred people at the company, it felt very feasible to know what was going on in most places.\nIt was around a year into being a Senior Engineer that I was invited to become a Staff Engineer, which at the time was parallel with the Senior Engineer role, having only a slightly different set of expectations. Being a Staff Engineer meant more talking about engineering problems and processes, more reviewing other peoples\u2019 code and ideas, less time writing my own code. Usually this is actually its own dedicated step along the career path, as it typically means you\u2019re some kind of dedicated domain owner in a much larger organization of engineers. I fell into it naturally, as I was already doing a lot of the kind of work it expected, which highlighted to me that the best career moves are often the obvious ones.\nHowever, over time it began to feel like Staff Engineer was a role that would be more practical at a larger company of hundreds or thousands of engineers, and actually impractical at Tumblr\u2019s size of just a hundred or so engineers. To me, many of the responsibilities of our Staff Engineer group felt like they should be that of any Senior Engineer or Managers\/Directors. Many of our tasks involved shepherding other engineers and providing insight into how to fix hard problems, and defining processes that affected most engineers.\nA lot of those processes were very administrative and felt like they\u2019d be more enforceable if they came from someone at the executive level. At times, Staff Engineering also felt like the dreaded \u201civory tower\u201d approach to engineering, in which a select few get to decide what\u2019s best for everyone, which I strongly disagree with. I hopped out of the Staff Engineer role after nine months or so, and the Staff Engineering group was dissolved shortly after I left it.\nBecoming More Independent\nAfter spending so much time spreading myself around the company, I gradually shifted out of being tied to a single team and I became a kind of \u201cfloater\u201d among the product engineering teams. I started tackling bigger problems with our legacy systems (such as getting them GDPR compliant) and helping shape the architecture of new features (such as the Neue Post Format). I had become the same kind of engineer as those who had helped me build messaging, acting more as someone who isn\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty contending with the obscure parts of a ten year old codebase. It was around this time that I wrote How I Code Now and How I Review Code, as a lot of my job felt like it was honing those skills to a sharp point.\nAs I became a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer, more of my work became self-directed rather than decided for me by a supervisor. Instead of being given tickets to solve in a sprint, I got to do a combination of choosing my own work and being asked to help in certain areas by other managers and my supervisor. I went wherever that focus was needed, which still meant more time talking about problems, but now also more time writing framework code in support of other engineers.\nAfter gaining a lot of experience in how Tumblr worked, it became easier for me to see where there were opportunities for improvement, both engineering- and product-wise. Since most of my passion is in the product work, I was given the latitude to try to push forward Tumblr\u2019s product features more directly. Some of these projects I ran with myself, like the last three years of April Fools jokes and revamping Tumblrbot and pushing the Neue Post Format, but a lot of the time I\u2019ve tried to help empower feature work that I\u2019m just passionate about and want to see succeed.\nSince I worked alone at my previous job for a very long time, I already had the ability to be self-directed and to self-organize. I try to keep my work well documented, I like to keep a trail of emails and tickets to show what I\u2019m working on and have finished, and I can mentally context switch quickly between many different ongoing tasks. Most of that context switching ability centers around assigning priority to every task I do. If a project or task has no priority, it usually never gets done, but that\u2019s fine; there is always more to do than can ever be done. Sometimes I have \u201crainy days\u201d when I can pull something from the bottom of the priority list that I\u2019ve wanted to do for awhile but not had time.\nIt was also around this time of becoming more self-directed that I began mentoring other engineers one-on-one, and working with them to help them grow in the same way that I had, or in whatever way they wanted to grow. Sometimes I join a specific team for a brief period, usually acting as a force-multiplier to the output of a team while I was on it. I like to tear through challenges and make big difficult decisions when they need to be made, talking and documenting them out to reinforce shared knowledge, while trying to avoid the pitfalls of seeking perfection. One example of that is the ongoing Neue Post Format project, which has involved huge refactors of existing code, tons of new code, and a complete overhaul of how all new posts on Tumblr are stored and represented. Not to mention thousands upon thousands of words of documentation.\nAll of this led me to becoming a Principal Engineer, which is where I\u2019m at now. For me, it\u2019s a role that expects continuous mentorship and sponsorship of other engineers, constant vigilance of best practices, tons and tons of code review and architecture-building, and heightened mindfulness of ones\u2019 words and actions. In my experience so far, it\u2019s a lot of talking and writing about engineering while making big, difficult engineering decisions, and actually writing fewer, but higher impact, lines of code.\nMoving beyond Principal Engineer is a difficult and rare task. Of the hundred or so engineers at Tumblr, there are only a handful of Principal Engineers, and even fewer Senior Principals. From my understanding, moving beyond Principal at Tumblr means being a framework-level domain owner and decision maker, contributing to the entire scale of Tumblr\u2019s success. I\u2019m still trying to figure out if that challenge is something that interests me, but in the meantime there are more than enough challenges at Tumblr to keep me busy.\nBy the way, if my story sounds like an interesting adventure to you, we\u2019re hiring.",

    "post_text":"I\u2019ve been at Tumblr for four years as of last month, and in those four years I\u2019ve moved from Engineer to Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer. Everyone\u2019s journey along the path of their career is different, and engineering is a little different everywhere, but this is my story. My hope is that it provides some insight into Tumblr\u2019s career ladder and some themes that are universal across engineering cultures at other companies.\nPrelude: Full Stack Madness\nBefore I joined Tumblr, I worked for ten (!!!) years as a full stack developer at a college, mostly alone. I\u2019d been writing code (poorly) and immersing myself in tech since I was a kid, so I felt pretty confident as a teenager taking a job building websites for my college.\nOver the course of that ten-year job, I went from writing terrible PHP and Javascript to performing the ultra full stack of work: rack-mounting servers, installing operating systems on them, splitting them up into application servers and database servers and whatnot, managing them often, writing application logic to run on and across them, designing databases (relational and NoSQL), designing user interfaces, bridging lots of different APIs, and scaling my applications to meet greater demands. Way too much for one person to do, really.\nIt was an opportunity for me to get my hands on all facets of building things for the internet. It afforded ample time to figure out what felt best for me, which turned out to be backend application development. I probably waited way too long before moving on to my next job, which luckily became Tumblr. When I did get the job at Tumblr, I had two main goals: to work as a component of a team rather than alone, and to focus on backend engineering.\nBeing heads-down as an Engineer\nWhen I joined Tumblr, I came on as an Engineer. It\u2019s technically a step above \u201centry level\u201d at most companies, and it was the baseline for new engineering hires at Tumblr at the time. Someone at the Engineer level at Tumblr is expected to be a team member who focuses on a certain technical domain, such as databases, SRE, iOS, Android, Javascript, PHP, Scala, etc. For me, in product engineering, this roughly translated into being either a frontend engineer (iOS, Android, Javascript) or a backend engineer (PHP, Scala). When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.\nThe Engineer level usually means you\u2019re someone who is relatively \u201cheads-down\u201d, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on. That was me \u2014 at the time I joined we were working on finishing up the \u201cnew\u201d post forms on the web, and my team was about to start building blog-to-blog instant messaging. I worked with senior engineers to flesh out the architecture for messaging, and through that I learned how to build something that seemed simple to me but became very complex at scale. I churned through a lot of tickets and wrote a lot of code, almost entirely feature logic, rarely touching anything outside of my domain.\nWhile I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in meetings or making decisions, I did get to have a voice in pretty much everything my team worked on, and I felt empowered by my manager to speak my mind across the company. During my first year that actually got me in trouble, as I become a bit overconfident in my own opinion, and I didn\u2019t have the experience necessary to back much of it up. That was a good learning experience for me; it taught me how to pick my battles and when to use my voice and speak my mind. Sometimes saying nothing is the best option, and it\u2019s important to keep yourself mindful of what your voice is actually contributing.\nOpening up avenues into Senior Engineering\nAfter my first year I started feeling very familiar with Tumblr\u2019s engineering practices and a couple of lucky opportunities appeared. The first was being asked to act as a pseudo-member of the Core PHP team since they were understaffed, which broadened my responsibilities and gave me a reason to start digging around in our framework-level code. It afforded me time to learn a lot about our framework level and our design patterns, and I made some fundamental changes to how the Tumblr PHP app works. More importantly, it almost doubled the amount of code I was expected to review, much of it outside of my previous work as a product engineer.\nAround that time, the senior engineers I was working with on messaging moved on from the project, leaving pretty much just me to finish the work a few months before we launched. Because of this, almost all of the PHP logic that exists for messaging on Tumblr is my code, and I became the go-to authority on how messaging works under the hood.\nAfter launch, we continued to iterate on messaging features. A few of these iterations required heavy refactors of a system that was humming along, being used by millions of people. I learned how to make dramatic changes without anyone who was using the product noticing, and I started being one of the engineers who\u2019d help others do the same for their projects.\nOne example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it\u2019d be like to lead cross-team efforts.\nI also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents \u2014 at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr\u2019s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn\u2019t afraid to get my hands dirty.\nAll of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.\nRaising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer\nAs a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me. The feeling of being uncomfortable became comfortable for me; I got used to being in a position where I didn\u2019t have a ready solution to a problem, and I was happy to say so, but I felt confident I could figure it out by drawing on my past experience and doing some research.\nI started being consulted by other teams when they\u2019d be scoping out new projects, and I had a good sense for why a project could be difficult or easy. I also started going to meetings that had nothing to do with my normal job responsibilities, as I felt that it was important to stay on top of what was happening outside of those responsibilities. With only a couple hundred people at the company, it felt very feasible to know what was going on in most places.\nIt was around a year into being a Senior Engineer that I was invited to become a Staff Engineer, which at the time was parallel with the Senior Engineer role, having only a slightly different set of expectations. Being a Staff Engineer meant more talking about engineering problems and processes, more reviewing other peoples\u2019 code and ideas, less time writing my own code. Usually this is actually its own dedicated step along the career path, as it typically means you\u2019re some kind of dedicated domain owner in a much larger organization of engineers. I fell into it naturally, as I was already doing a lot of the kind of work it expected, which highlighted to me that the best career moves are often the obvious ones.\nHowever, over time it began to feel like Staff Engineer was a role that would be more practical at a larger company of hundreds or thousands of engineers, and actually impractical at Tumblr\u2019s size of just a hundred or so engineers. To me, many of the responsibilities of our Staff Engineer group felt like they should be that of any Senior Engineer or Managers\/Directors. Many of our tasks involved shepherding other engineers and providing insight into how to fix hard problems, and defining processes that affected most engineers.\nA lot of those processes were very administrative and felt like they\u2019d be more enforceable if they came from someone at the executive level. At times, Staff Engineering also felt like the dreaded \u201civory tower\u201d approach to engineering, in which a select few get to decide what\u2019s best for everyone, which I strongly disagree with. I hopped out of the Staff Engineer role after nine months or so, and the Staff Engineering group was dissolved shortly after I left it.\nBecoming More Independent\nAfter spending so much time spreading myself around the company, I gradually shifted out of being tied to a single team and I became a kind of \u201cfloater\u201d among the product engineering teams. I started tackling bigger problems with our legacy systems (such as getting them GDPR compliant) and helping shape the architecture of new features (such as the Neue Post Format). I had become the same kind of engineer as those who had helped me build messaging, acting more as someone who isn\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty contending with the obscure parts of a ten year old codebase. It was around this time that I wrote How I Code Now and How I Review Code, as a lot of my job felt like it was honing those skills to a sharp point.\nAs I became a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer, more of my work became self-directed rather than decided for me by a supervisor. Instead of being given tickets to solve in a sprint, I got to do a combination of choosing my own work and being asked to help in certain areas by other managers and my supervisor. I went wherever that focus was needed, which still meant more time talking about problems, but now also more time writing framework code in support of other engineers.\nAfter gaining a lot of experience in how Tumblr worked, it became easier for me to see where there were opportunities for improvement, both engineering- and product-wise. Since most of my passion is in the product work, I was given the latitude to try to push forward Tumblr\u2019s product features more directly. Some of these projects I ran with myself, like the last three years of April Fools jokes and revamping Tumblrbot and pushing the Neue Post Format, but a lot of the time I\u2019ve tried to help empower feature work that I\u2019m just passionate about and want to see succeed.\nSince I worked alone at my previous job for a very long time, I already had the ability to be self-directed and to self-organize. I try to keep my work well documented, I like to keep a trail of emails and tickets to show what I\u2019m working on and have finished, and I can mentally context switch quickly between many different ongoing tasks. Most of that context switching ability centers around assigning priority to every task I do. If a project or task has no priority, it usually never gets done, but that\u2019s fine; there is always more to do than can ever be done. Sometimes I have \u201crainy days\u201d when I can pull something from the bottom of the priority list that I\u2019ve wanted to do for awhile but not had time.\nIt was also around this time of becoming more self-directed that I began mentoring other engineers one-on-one, and working with them to help them grow in the same way that I had, or in whatever way they wanted to grow. Sometimes I join a specific team for a brief period, usually acting as a force-multiplier to the output of a team while I was on it. I like to tear through challenges and make big difficult decisions when they need to be made, talking and documenting them out to reinforce shared knowledge, while trying to avoid the pitfalls of seeking perfection. One example of that is the ongoing Neue Post Format project, which has involved huge refactors of existing code, tons of new code, and a complete overhaul of how all new posts on Tumblr are stored and represented. Not to mention thousands upon thousands of words of documentation.\nAll of this led me to becoming a Principal Engineer, which is where I\u2019m at now. For me, it\u2019s a role that expects continuous mentorship and sponsorship of other engineers, constant vigilance of best practices, tons and tons of code review and architecture-building, and heightened mindfulness of ones\u2019 words and actions.

When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.\nThe Engineer level usually means you\u2019re someone who is relatively \u201cheads-down\u201d, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on. That was me \u2014 at the time I joined we were working on finishing up the \u201cnew\u201d post forms on the web, and my team was about to start building blog-to-blog instant messaging. I worked with senior engineers to flesh out the architecture for messaging, and through that I learned how to build something that seemed simple to me but became very complex at scale. I churned through a lot of tickets and wrote a lot of code, almost entirely feature logic, rarely touching anything outside of my domain.\nWhile I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in meetings or making decisions, I did get to have a voice in pretty much everything my team worked on, and I felt empowered by my manager to speak my mind across the company. During my first year that actually got me in trouble, as I become a bit overconfident in my own opinion, and I didn\u2019t have the experience necessary to back much of it up. That was a good learning experience for me; it taught me how to pick my battles and when to use my voice and speak my mind. Sometimes saying nothing is the best option, and it\u2019s important to keep yourself mindful of what your voice is actually contributing.\nOpening up avenues into Senior Engineering\nAfter my first year I started feeling very familiar with Tumblr\u2019s engineering practices and a couple of lucky opportunities appeared. The first was being asked to act as a pseudo-member of the Core PHP team since they were understaffed, which broadened my responsibilities and gave me a reason to start digging around in our framework-level code. It afforded me time to learn a lot about our framework level and our design patterns, and I made some fundamental changes to how the Tumblr PHP app works. More importantly, it almost doubled the amount of code I was expected to review, much of it outside of my previous work as a product engineer.\nAround that time, the senior engineers I was working with on messaging moved on from the project, leaving pretty much just me to finish the work a few months before we launched. Because of this, almost all of the PHP logic that exists for messaging on Tumblr is my code, and I became the go-to authority on how messaging works under the hood.\nAfter launch, we continued to iterate on messaging features. A few of these iterations required heavy refactors of a system that was humming along, being used by millions of people. I learned how to make dramatic changes without anyone who was using the product noticing, and I started being one of the engineers who\u2019d help others do the same for their projects.\nOne example of that kind of work was the Replies relaunch, which was outside my normal workload, but I lent a hand to help make sure it met the deadline we had set for ourselves. I also took the engineering lead on the infamous Lizard Election of 2016, coordinating work among designers, web engineers, iOS engineers, and Android engineers, while also building most of the backend for it myself. It was an extremely ambitious project that we put together in a very short period time, all for one absurd April Fools joke. The community loved it (or was extremely confused by it), and it provided a lot of insight for me into what it\u2019d be like to lead cross-team efforts.\nI also spent a lot of my first two years participating in Breaking Incidents \u2014 at Tumblr these are usually sudden high-impact problems that need to be fixed quickly, usually by someone who is on call. I probably learned the most about Tumblr\u2019s features, systems, and edge cases while helping fix these problems. Sometimes these incidents were small, like just a user interface bug that had been accidentally deployed, and sometimes these incidents were huge, such as entire database clusters failing. Jumping in and helping to quickly resolve these incidents showed that I wasn\u2019t afraid to get my hands dirty.\nAll of this additional responsibility meant I started going to more meetings and talking to more people across the company, as I had carved out a space that I felt was my own. It was really difficult and uncomfortable a lot of the time, and I made mistakes that broke things, but fixing them, persevering, and learning not to repeat them showed how much I was ready for a more senior role. I got promoted to Senior Engineer and stayed at that level for two and a half years, with a brief interlude as a Staff Engineer.\nRaising the stakes as a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer\nAs a Senior Engineer, I felt much more empowered to take on difficult tasks, as I had a couple of major, successful projects behind me. The feeling of being uncomfortable became comfortable for me; I got used to being in a position where I didn\u2019t have a ready solution to a problem, and I was happy to say so, but I felt confident I could figure it out by drawing on my past experience and doing some research.\nI started being consulted by other teams when they\u2019d be scoping out new projects, and I had a good sense for why a project could be difficult or easy. I also started going to meetings that had nothing to do with my normal job responsibilities, as I felt that it was important to stay on top of what was happening outside of those responsibilities. With only a couple hundred people at the company, it felt very feasible to know what was going on in most places.\nIt was around a year into being a Senior Engineer that I was invited to become a Staff Engineer, which at the time was parallel with the Senior Engineer role, having only a slightly different set of expectations. Being a Staff Engineer meant more talking about engineering problems and processes, more reviewing other peoples\u2019 code and ideas, less time writing my own code. Usually this is actually its own dedicated step along the career path, as it typically means you\u2019re some kind of dedicated domain owner in a much larger organization of engineers. I fell into it naturally, as I was already doing a lot of the kind of work it expected, which highlighted to me that the best career moves are often the obvious ones.\nHowever, over time it began to feel like Staff Engineer was a role that would be more practical at a larger company of hundreds or thousands of engineers, and actually impractical at Tumblr\u2019s size of just a hundred or so engineers. To me, many of the responsibilities of our Staff Engineer group felt like they should be that of any Senior Engineer or Managers\/Directors. Many of our tasks involved shepherding other engineers and providing insight into how to fix hard problems, and defining processes that affected most engineers.\nA lot of those processes were very administrative and felt like they\u2019d be more enforceable if they came from someone at the executive level. At times, Staff Engineering also felt like the dreaded \u201civory tower\u201d approach to engineering, in which a select few get to decide what\u2019s best for everyone, which I strongly disagree with. I hopped out of the Staff Engineer role after nine months or so, and the Staff Engineering group was dissolved shortly after I left it.\nBecoming More Independent\nAfter spending so much time spreading myself around the company, I gradually shifted out of being tied to a single team and I became a kind of \u201cfloater\u201d among the product engineering teams. I started tackling bigger problems with our legacy systems (such as getting them GDPR compliant) and helping shape the architecture of new features (such as the Neue Post Format). I had become the same kind of engineer as those who had helped me build messaging, acting more as someone who isn\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty contending with the obscure parts of a ten year old codebase. It was around this time that I wrote How I Code Now and How I Review Code, as a lot of my job felt like it was honing those skills to a sharp point.\nAs I became a Senior Engineer and then Staff Engineer, more of my work became self-directed rather than decided for me by a supervisor. Instead of being given tickets to solve in a sprint, I got to do a combination of choosing my own work and being asked to help in certain areas by other managers and my supervisor. I went wherever that focus was needed, which still meant more time talking about problems, but now also more time writing framework code in support of other engineers.\nAfter gaining a lot of experience in how Tumblr worked, it became easier for me to see where there were opportunities for improvement, both engineering- and product-wise. Since most of my passion is in the product work, I was given the latitude to try to push forward Tumblr\u2019s product features more directly. Some of these projects I ran with myself, like the last three years of April Fools jokes and revamping Tumblrbot and pushing the Neue Post Format, but a lot of the time I\u2019ve tried to help empower feature work that I\u2019m just passionate about and want to see succeed.\nSince I worked alone at my previous job for a very long time, I already had the ability to be self-directed and to self-organize. I try to keep my work well documented, I like to keep a trail of emails and tickets to show what I\u2019m working on and have finished, and I can mentally context switch quickly between many different ongoing tasks. Most of that context switching ability centers around assigning priority to every task I do. If a project or task has no priority, it usually never gets done, but that\u2019s fine; there is always more to do than can ever be done. Sometimes I have \u201crainy days\u201d when I can pull something from the bottom of the priority list that I\u2019ve wanted to do for awhile but not had time.\nIt was also around this time of becoming more self-directed that I began mentoring other engineers one-on-one, and working with them to help them grow in the same way that I had, or in whatever way they wanted to grow. Sometimes I join a specific team for a brief period, usually acting as a force-multiplier to the output of a team while I was on it. I like to tear through challenges and make big difficult decisions when they need to be made, talking and documenting them out to reinforce shared knowledge, while trying to avoid the pitfalls of seeking perfection. One example of that is the ongoing Neue Post Format project, which has involved huge refactors of existing code, tons of new code, and a complete overhaul of how all new posts on Tumblr are stored and represented. Not to mention thousands upon thousands of words of documentation.\nAll of this led me to becoming a Principal Engineer, which is where I\u2019m at now. For me, it\u2019s a role that expects continuous mentorship and sponsorship of other engineers, constant vigilance of best practices, tons and tons of code review and architecture-building, and heightened mindfulness of ones\u2019 words and actions. In my experience so far, it\u2019s a lot of talking and writing about engineering while making big, difficult engineering decisions, and actually writing fewer, but higher impact, lines of code.\nMoving beyond Principal Engineer is a difficult and rare task. Of the hundred or so engineers at Tumblr, there are only a handful of Principal Engineers, and even fewer Senior Principals. From my understanding, moving beyond Principal at Tumblr means being a framework-level domain owner and decision maker, contributing to the entire scale of Tumblr\u2019s success. I\u2019m still trying to figure out if that challenge is something that interests me, but in the meantime there are more than enough challenges at Tumblr to keep me busy.\nBy the way, if my story sounds like an interesting adventure to you, we\u2019re hiring.",

    "post_text":"I\u2019ve been at Tumblr for four years as of last month, and in those four years I\u2019ve moved from Engineer to Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer. Everyone\u2019s journey along the path of their career is different, and engineering is a little different everywhere, but this is my story. My hope is that it provides some insight into Tumblr\u2019s career ladder and some themes that are universal across engineering cultures at other companies.\nPrelude: Full Stack Madness\nBefore I joined Tumblr, I worked for ten (!!!) years as a full stack developer at a college, mostly alone. I\u2019d been writing code (poorly) and immersing myself in tech since I was a kid, so I felt pretty confident as a teenager taking a job building websites for my college.\nOver the course of that ten-year job, I went from writing terrible PHP and Javascript to performing the ultra full stack of work: rack-mounting servers, installing operating systems on them, splitting them up into application servers and database servers and whatnot, managing them often, writing application logic to run on and across them, designing databases (relational and NoSQL), designing user interfaces, bridging lots of different APIs, and scaling my applications to meet greater demands. Way too much for one person to do, really.\nIt was an opportunity for me to get my hands on all facets of building things for the internet. It afforded ample time to figure out what felt best for me, which turned out to be backend application development. I probably waited way too long before moving on to my next job, which luckily became Tumblr. When I did get the job at Tumblr, I had two main goals: to work as a component of a team rather than alone, and to focus on backend engineering.\nBeing heads-down as an Engineer\nWhen I joined Tumblr, I came on as an Engineer. It\u2019s technically a step above \u201centry level\u201d at most companies, and it was the baseline for new engineering hires at Tumblr at the time. Someone at the Engineer level at Tumblr is expected to be a team member who focuses on a certain technical domain, such as databases, SRE, iOS, Android, Javascript, PHP, Scala, etc. For me, in product engineering, this roughly translated into being either a frontend engineer (iOS, Android, Javascript) or a backend engineer (PHP, Scala). When I started, I did a little bit of both since I had experience with both, but over the course of my first year I shed a lot of my frontend knowledge in favor of deepening my backend knowledge.\nThe Engineer level usually means you\u2019re someone who is relatively \u201cheads-down\u201d, being given tickets to complete during sprints which contribute to a larger project that your team is working on.

    "post_text":"How we wrote our own Service Worker\nAs we continue the process of reinvigorating Tumblr\u2019s frontend web development, we\u2019re always on the lookout for modern web technologies, especially ones that make our mobile site feel faster and more native. You could have guessed that we are making the mobile dashboard into a progressive app when we open-sourced our webpack plugin to make web app manifests back in August. And you would\u2019ve been right. But to make a high quality progressive web app, you need more than just a web app manifest\u2014you also need a service worker.\nWhat is a service worker?\nA service worker is a helper script that a page registers with the browser. After it is registered (some people like to also call it \u201cinstalled\u201d), the browser periodically checks the script for changes. If any part of the script contents changes, the browser reinstalls the updated script.\nService workers are most commonly used to intercept browser fetches and do various things with them. https:\/\/serviceworke.rs has a lot of great ideas about what you can do with service workers, with code examples. We decided to use our service worker to cache some JS, CSS, and font assets when it is installed, and to respond with those assets when the browser fetches any of them.\nUsing a service worker to precache assets\nYou might be wondering \u201cwhy would you want to pre-cache assets when the service worker is installed? Isn\u2019t that the same thing that the browser cache does?\u201d While the browser cache does cache assets after they\u2019re requested, our service worker can cache assets before they\u2019re requested. This greatly speeds up parts of the page that we load in asynchronously, like the notes popover, or blogs that you tap into from the mobile dashboard.\nWhile there are open-source projects that generate service workers to pre-cache your assets (like, for example, sw-precache), we chose to build our own service worker. When I started this project, I didn\u2019t have any idea what service workers were, and I wanted to learn all about them. And what better way to learn about service workers than building one?\nHow our service worker is built\nBecause the service worker needs to know about all of the JS, CSS, and font assets in order to pre-cache them, we build a piece of the service worker during our build phase. This part of the service worker changes whenever our assets are updated. During the build step, we take a list of all of the assets that are output, filter them down into just the ones we want to pre-cache, and write them out to an array in a JS file that we call sw.js.\nThat service worker file importScripts()\u2019s a separate file that contains all of our service worker functionality. All of the service worker functionality is built separately and written in TypeScript, but the file that contains all of our assets is plain JavaScript.\nWe decided to serve our service worker directly from our node.js app. Our other assets are served using CDNs. Because our CDN servers are often geographically closer to our users, our assets load faster from there than they do from our app. Using CDNs also keeps simple, asset-transfer traffic away from our app, which gives us space us to do more complicated things (like rendering your dashboard with React).\nTo keep asset traffic that reaches our app to a minimum, we tell our CDNs not to check back for updates to our assets for a long time. This is sometimes referred to as caching with a long TTL (time to live). As we know, cache-invalidation is a tough computer science problem, so we generate unique filenames based on the asset contents each time we build our assets. That way, when we request the new asset, we know that we\u2019re going to get it because we use the new file name.\nBecause the browser wants to check back in with the service worker script to see if there are any changes, caching it in our CDNs is not a good fit. We would have to figure out how to do cache invalidation for that file, but none of the other assets. By serving that file directly from our node.js application, we get some additional asset-transfer traffic to our application but we think it\u2019s worth it because it avoids all of the issues with caching.\nHow does it pre-cache assets?\nWhen the service worker is installed, it compares the asset list in sw.js to the list of assets that it has in its cache. If an asset is in the cache, but not listed in sw.js, the asset gets deleted from the cache. If an asset is in sw.js, but not in the service worker cache, we download and cache it. If an asset is in sw.js and in the cache, it hasn\u2019t changed, so we don\u2019t need to do anything.\n\/\/ in sw.js\nself.ASSETS = [\n  \u2018main.js\u2019,\n  \u2018notes-popover.js\u2019,\n  'favorit.woff\u2019\n];\n\/\/ in service-worker.ts\nself.addEventListener('install\u2019, install);\nconst install = event => event.waitUntil(\n  caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache\u2019)\n    .then(cache => {\n      const currentAssetList = self.ASSETS;\n      const oldAssets =\/* Instead of writing our own array diffing, we use lodash\u2019s *\/;\n      const newAssets =\/* differenceBy() to figure out which assets are old and new *\/;\n      return Promise.all([ \u2026oldAssets.map(oldAsset => cache.delete(oldAsset)), cache.addAll(newAssets)]);\n  });\n);\nWe launched \ud83d\ude80\nEarlier this month, we launched the service worker to all users of our mobile web dashboard. Our performance instrumentation initially found a small performance regression, but we fixed it. Now our mobile web dashboard load time is about the same as before, but asynchronous bundles on the page load much faster.\nWe fixed the performance regression by improving performance of the service worker cache. Initially, we naively opened the service worker cache for every request. But now we only open the cache once, when the service worker starts running. Once the cache is opened, we attach listeners for fetch requests, and those closures capture the open cache in their scope.\n\/\/ before\nself.addEventListener('fetch\u2019, handleFetch);\nconst handleFetch = event =>\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache\u2019)\n      .then(cache => cache.match(request)\n      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch\n        ?

Promise.resolve(cacheMatch)\n        : fetch(event.request)\n      )\n  );\nFuture plans\nWe have lots of future plans to make the service worker even better than it is now. In addition to pre-emptive caching, we would also like to do reactive caching, like the browser cache does. Every time an asset is requested that we do not already have in our cache, we could cache it. That will help keep the service worker cache fresh between installations.\nWe would also like to try building an API cache in our service worker, so that users can view some stale content while they\u2019re waiting for new content to load. We could also leverage this cache if we built a service-worker-based offline mode. If you have any interest in service workers or ideas about how Tumblr could use them in the future, we would love to have you on our team.\n- Paul \/ @blistering-pree",

You could have guessed that we are making the mobile dashboard into a progressive app when we open-sourced our webpack plugin to make web app manifests back in August. And you would\u2019ve been right. But to make a high quality progressive web app, you need more than just a web app manifest\u2014you also need a service worker.\nWhat is a service worker?\nA service worker is a helper script that a page registers with the browser. After it is registered (some people like to also call it \u201cinstalled\u201d), the browser periodically checks the script for changes. If any part of the script contents changes, the browser reinstalls the updated script.\nService workers are most commonly used to intercept browser fetches and do various things with them. https:\/\/serviceworke.rs has a lot of great ideas about what you can do with service workers, with code examples. We decided to use our service worker to cache some JS, CSS, and font assets when it is installed, and to respond with those assets when the browser fetches any of them.\nUsing a service worker to precache assets\nYou might be wondering \u201cwhy would you want to pre-cache assets when the service worker is installed? Isn\u2019t that the same thing that the browser cache does?\u201d While the browser cache does cache assets after they\u2019re requested, our service worker can cache assets before they\u2019re requested. This greatly speeds up parts of the page that we load in asynchronously, like the notes popover, or blogs that you tap into from the mobile dashboard.\nWhile there are open-source projects that generate service workers to pre-cache your assets (like, for example, sw-precache), we chose to build our own service worker. When I started this project, I didn\u2019t have any idea what service workers were, and I wanted to learn all about them. And what better way to learn about service workers than building one?\nHow our service worker is built\nBecause the service worker needs to know about all of the JS, CSS, and font assets in order to pre-cache them, we build a piece of the service worker during our build phase. This part of the service worker changes whenever our assets are updated. During the build step, we take a list of all of the assets that are output, filter them down into just the ones we want to pre-cache, and write them out to an array in a JS file that we call sw.js.\nThat service worker file importScripts()\u2019s a separate file that contains all of our service worker functionality. All of the service worker functionality is built separately and written in TypeScript, but the file that contains all of our assets is plain JavaScript.\nWe decided to serve our service worker directly from our node.js app. Our other assets are served using CDNs. Because our CDN servers are often geographically closer to our users, our assets load faster from there than they do from our app. Using CDNs also keeps simple, asset-transfer traffic away from our app, which gives us space us to do more complicated things (like rendering your dashboard with React).\nTo keep asset traffic that reaches our app to a minimum, we tell our CDNs not to check back for updates to our assets for a long time. This is sometimes referred to as caching with a long TTL (time to live). As we know, cache-invalidation is a tough computer science problem, so we generate unique filenames based on the asset contents each time we build our assets. That way, when we request the new asset, we know that we\u2019re going to get it because we use the new file name.\nBecause the browser wants to check back in with the service worker script to see if there are any changes, caching it in our CDNs is not a good fit. We would have to figure out how to do cache invalidation for that file, but none of the other assets. By serving that file directly from our node.js application, we get some additional asset-transfer traffic to our application but we think it\u2019s worth it because it avoids all of the issues with caching.\nHow does it pre-cache assets?\nWhen the service worker is installed, it compares the asset list in sw.js to the list of assets that it has in its cache. If an asset is in the cache, but not listed in sw.js, the asset gets deleted from the cache. If an asset is in sw.js, but not in the service worker cache, we download and cache it. If an asset is in sw.js and in the cache, it hasn\u2019t changed, so we don\u2019t need to do anything.\n\/\/ in sw.js\nself.ASSETS = [\n  \u2018main.js\u2019,\n  \u2018notes-popover.js\u2019,\n  'favorit.woff\u2019\n];\n\/\/ in service-worker.ts\nself.addEventListener('install\u2019, install);\nconst install = event => event.waitUntil(\n  caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache\u2019)\n    .then(cache => {\n      const currentAssetList = self.ASSETS;\n      const oldAssets =\/* Instead of writing our own array diffing, we use lodash\u2019s *\/;\n      const newAssets =\/* differenceBy() to figure out which assets are old and new *\/;\n      return Promise.all([ \u2026oldAssets.map(oldAsset => cache.delete(oldAsset)), cache.addAll(newAssets)]);\n  });\n);\nWe launched \ud83d\ude80\nEarlier this month, we launched the service worker to all users of our mobile web dashboard. Our performance instrumentation initially found a small performance regression, but we fixed it. Now our mobile web dashboard load time is about the same as before, but asynchronous bundles on the page load much faster.\nWe fixed the performance regression by improving performance of the service worker cache. Initially, we naively opened the service worker cache for every request. But now we only open the cache once, when the service worker starts running. Once the cache is opened, we attach listeners for fetch requests, and those closures capture the open cache in their scope.\n\/\/ before\nself.addEventListener('fetch\u2019, handleFetch);\nconst handleFetch = event =>\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.open('tumblr-service-worker-cache\u2019)\n      .then(cache => cache.match(request)\n      .then(cacheMatch => cacheMatch\n        ?

In addition to pre-emptive caching, we would also like to do reactive caching, like the browser cache does. Every time an asset is requested that we do not already have in our cache, we could cache it. That will help keep the service worker cache fresh between installations.\nWe would also like to try building an API cache in our service worker, so that users can view some stale content while they\u2019re waiting for new content to load. We could also leverage this cache if we built a service-worker-based offline mode. If you have any interest in service workers or ideas about how Tumblr could use them in the future, we would love to have you on our team.\n- Paul \/ @blistering-pree",

    "post_text":"If you\u2019re an avid user of Tumblr on mobile web, then you might\u2019ve noticed some improvements we made. Bigger font sizes and higher contrast text? Your screen reader actually reads what you hope it would? You\u2019ve guessed it, we\u2019re making Tumblr \u2728accessible\u2728.\nWhy?\nSince we\u2019re rewriting the web, we wanted to make sure we did so with accessibility in mind. I could give you a long description why, but plenty of articles explain better than I can. Put simply: the web should be made useable for everyone.\nWe began with using the accessibility auditing tool in Google Lighthouse to check the improvements that could be made. Initially, our score wasn\u2019t that great: 62. If you factored in areas that need to be manually checked then our score would have been abysmal. However, we\u2019ve made great strides since then and are on our way to achieving that coveted \ud83d\udcaf\nWe had inaccessible menus and poorly described elements, among other things. Using a tool like VoiceOver or TalkBalk you can see what experiencing Tumblr on mobile web with a screen reader was like. Here\u2019s a gif showing what the mobile web experience on Tumblr was like prior to the changes.\nWhat we did\nSome of the more noticeable improvements we made were introducing design changes to increase readability and making improvements following WAI-ARIA guidelines. We\u2019ll walk through a few other changes we made using React.\nVisual order on the page follows DOM order\nOne of the larger changes we made was to revamp modals and popovers (e.g., the post activity screen). Originally we used React Portals but it isn\u2019t always the most friendly for accessibility. Ideally you want to have elements appear in logical DOM order and Portals provides a way to circumvent that. So, no more Portals!\nThe user\u2019s focus is directed to new content added to the page\nNext step was to provide a way to manage focus.

    "post_text":"Making a progressive web app with webpack just got a little bit easier\nToday we are releasing webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin, which generates an app manifest that shows up in your assets manifest.\nI heard you like manifests\nTurns out, there are a lot of web things called \u201cmanifests\u201d. When talking about web app manifests and assets manifests, sometimes it\u2019s hard to keep track. Buckle up, because we made a webpack plugin that deals with both of these types of manifests.\nWeb app manifests are JSON files that allow your application to specify the way it should be treated when installed as an application on a mobile device. You may want to specify what the application name and icon should be. Maybe you want to tell the browser to tint some of its UI elements to match the color scheme of your page, or even hide the browser chrome entirely.

    "post_text":"A Breath of Life: Welcome the Brand New Mobile Web Dashboard\nWe rebuilt another piece of the site with React\nBackground\nA few months ago my colleague Robbie wrote a post about how the Core Web team is introducing a new web stack built on Docker, Node, and React. It is a beautiful vision, but we had only launched one tiny page on that infrastructure. This spring, we used that new stack to rebuild the mobile web dashboard from the ground up. And then we launched it.\nWhy we did it\nWe decided on building the mobile dashboard next for a few reasons. First, the dashboard is one of the most important parts of Tumblr\u2014for many people it is their primary window into the content here. Because of that, most things that we develop inevitably touch the dashboard. It was time to raise the stakes.\nThe desktop dashboard and the mobile apps have been moving forward at a blistering pace, but have you seen the mobile web dashboard? It was stuck in 2015. Nobody ever made features for it because it was a completely separate codebase. We avoided that issue with the rewrite. Since the new version we\u2019re building is responsive, our new mobile web dashboard will eventually also power the desktop web dashboard experience. This\u2019ll make it much easier to maintain feature parity between the desktop and mobile web experiences.\nFinally, we wanted to make something a little bit more complex than the image page, and the mobile web dashboard seemed like a good next step. It allowed us to start making authenticated API calls and figuring out how to pass cookies through our new server to and from our API; to think about laying the groundwork for a totally responsive dashboard, so we can eventually launch this for the desktop; to make a testing ground for progressive web app features like web app manifests; to start rendering posts that are backed by the new post format; and to figure out how to slowly roll out the new stack to a consistent, small set of users. We also had a pretty bad performance bug and learned a whole lot about profiling Node. (We plan on writing more in-depth posts about some of these topics soon.)\nIt is good\nAnd the rewrite turned out really well. Even with more features like pull-to-refresh, a new activity popover, and modern audio and video players, we sped up our DOM content loaded time by 35%! The new page has a lot of modern web standards in it too like srcsets, flexbox, asynchronous bundle loading, and a web app manifest. You can install the mobile web dashboard as a standalone app now. It was also way faster and simpler to write using React than it was on our old PHP\/Backbone stack.\nWe\u2019re really proud of the new mobile web dashboard. We look forward to bringing even more new features to it in the near future, and launching even more pages on our new web infrastructure.\nIf you think this is cool too, come work with us!\n\u2013 Paul Rehkugler (@blistering-pree)",
